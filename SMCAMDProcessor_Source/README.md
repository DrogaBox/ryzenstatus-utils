## Overview & Architecture

SMCAMDProcessor and AMD Power Gadget (Tahoe Edition) represent a complete architectural modernization of the AMD Ryzen macOS telemetry stack. Re-engineered from the ground up for enterprise-grade kernel safety, microsecond hardware precision, and native Apple silicon-like software efficiency, this project delivers real-time monitoring and autonomous power management for Ryzentosh systems.

---

## Key Technical Features

### 1. Enterprise Kernel Safety & Hardening (AMDRyzenCPUPowerManagement.kext)
- Authentic XNU Privilege Validation: Replaced mock privilege checks with authentic kernel root verification via `proc_suser` and `kauth_cred_getuid`.
- Boundary-Checked String Tables & Mach-O Verification: Strict bounds checking on symbol table lookups (`kernel_resolver.c`) and explicit `MH_MAGIC_64` header verification prior to function resolution.
- IPC Lifecycle Integrity: Strict 6-step teardown sequence during driver unload (`stop()`), retaining `fIOPCIDevice` and eliminating dangling pointers or memory leaks.
- **v3.24.0 Security Audit Hardening:**
  - Per-Family SMU Mailbox Descriptor: Safe register addressing for Zen 3/4/5; Curve Optimizer writes blocked on Zen 4/5 until AGESA validation
  - Expanded Intel MSR Blocklist: Added 0xE2, 0x1AD, 0x345, 0x610–0x617 to prevent #GP faults on AMD
  - Atomic Instruction Fixes: Corrected `lock incq/decq` → `lock incl/decl` on 32-bit vars; `kextloadAlerts++` → `OSIncrementAtomic`
  - KASLR Symbol Stabilization: Migrated from fragile `printf` reference to stable `&version` symbol
  - SMN Per-Family Register Selection: Family-aware PCI control register offsets for future Zen generation compatibility
  - MWAIT Idle Path Interrupt Fix: Prevented latent scheduler hangs with missing `sti` after MWAIT exit (MWAIT code path later removed in v3.31.0 — never functional on AMD desktop CPUs)
  - Zen 5 Temperature Offset Safety: Disabled unverified 49°C compensation on Zen 5 until PPR validation
- Privilege model (v3.16.1+): any process may open the UserClient for **read** telemetry; **writes** require root or `-amdpnopchk`. Process name is logged for audit only and is never used for authorization.

### 2. Micro-Architecture & Memory Optimization
- 64-Byte Cache Line Alignment: Applied `alignas(64)` alignment to core data structures (`pmProcessor_t`), isolating per-thread state to L1 cache lines and eliminating false sharing across all 32 logical threads of high-end desktop (HEDT) processors.
- Kernel RAM Footprint Reduction: Reduced per-core memory footprint from 8288 bytes down to 128 bytes, lowering total driver RAM allocation from 265KB to just 4KB on 32-thread architectures.
- XNU_MAX_CPU Perimeter Protection: Built-in perimeter boundary guards across processor indexing loops to prevent out-of-bounds array access on multi-core Ryzen 9 and Threadripper systems.
- Sleep/Wake Race Condition Prevention: `serviceInitialized` guardrails across timer callbacks combined with automatic TSC base re-synchronization upon sleep and wake transitions.

### 3. Precision RAPL Energy & Sensor Telemetry (SMCAMDProcessor.kext)
- Dynamic RAPL Power Scaling: Hardware MSR decoding (`0xC0010299`) with `1ULL << energyStatusUnits` exponent math for accurate package wattage calculations across Zen 3 and Zen 5.
- Granular per-CCD Thermal Monitoring: Direct PCI die register queries exposing individual CCD temperatures (VirtualSMC `TCxC` / `TCxc` keys) with automatic package fallback for multi-die CPUs.
- Expanded Super I/O Fan Support: Native RPM monitoring and hardware PWM fan curve controls for Nuvoton NCT668X/NCT67XX family (including NCT6799D and NCT6701D) and ITE IT86XXE family (including IT8628E, IT8686E, and IT8689E) controllers.

### 4. High-Performance Dashboard & Menu Bar Extra (AMD Power Gadget.app)
- MainActor Serial I/O Offloading: Hardware sampling operations are decoupled off the main thread onto a high-priority serial queue (`ioQueue`) with skip-if-busy guards, guaranteeing smooth 60 FPS UI rendering under max load.
- Diff-Based Rendering Engine: Smart threshold tracking skips redundant menu bar extra redraws (`setNeedsDisplay`) when sensor metrics fluctuate within idle tolerances.
- In-Process Zero-Allocation Network Analytics: Direct CChar ASCII buffer parsing using `sysctl(NET_RT_IFLIST2)` eliminates heap allocations, backed by an adaptive low-frequency background sampling mode.
- macOS 26 Tahoe UI Aesthetics: Designed with native Liquid Glass material vibrancy (`NSVisualEffectView`) and dynamic hierarchical SF Symbols 7+ fill glyphs (`cpu.fill`, `fan.fill`, `memorycard.fill`).
- Hardware-Autonomous CPPC & EPP Control: Native opt-in (`-amdcppcactive`) for CPPC Active Mode, delegating microsecond clock scaling to the internal System Management Unit (SMU) with configurable EPP profiles (Performance, Balanced, Power Save).
- In-App Language Picker: **Themes & Appearance → Language** forces any bundled locale (`en`, `es`, `de`, `it`, …) or System Default; applied at launch via `AppleLanguages` with Apply & Restart.
- Privilege UX Banner: When a write is denied (`kIOReturnNotPrivileged`), the dashboard shows a clear orange banner instead of silent failure (root or `-amdpnopchk` required for controls).

### 5. UserClient privilege model (v3.16.1+ / current: 3.16.2)
- **Reads** (telemetry, fan RPM, temps): any process may open the UserClient — the menu bar app works without root.
- **Writes** (fans, EPP, P-States, Curve Optimizer, SuperIO, …): require **root** or the explicit boot-arg **`-amdpnopchk`**.
- Authorization is **not** based on process name (spoof-resistant). On denial, the dashboard shows a privilege banner (3.16.2). Details: [docs/PRIVILEGE_AND_SECURITY.md](docs/PRIVILEGE_AND_SECURITY.md).

## Supported AMD Processors

Full compatibility with all AMD Zen architectures supported by the AMD Vanilla kernel patches.
Each processor family has a dedicated CPU profile defining available power management features:

| Generation | Family | Models | CPUs | PM Dispatch | Legacy P-States | CPPC |
|-----------|--------|--------|------|-------------|-----------------|------|
| **Zen 1** | 17h | 01h–0Fh | Ryzen 1000, Threadripper 1000 | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Zen+** | 17h | 10h–2Fh | Ryzen 2000, Threadripper 2000 | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Zen 2** | 17h | 30h+ | Ryzen 3000, Threadripper 3000 | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Zen 3 (Cezanne)** | 19h | 10h–1Fh | Ryzen 5000 APU | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Zen 3 (Vermeer)** | 19h | 21h–2Fh | Ryzen 5000 desktop | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Zen 3+ (Rembrandt)** | 19h | 40h–5Fh | Ryzen 6000 Mobile | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Zen 4** | 19h | 60h–7Fh | Ryzen 7000, Threadripper 7000 | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Zen 5** | 1Ah | 40h–4Fh | Ryzen 9000 Granite Ridge | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

*Note: Zen 1/2 use direct P-state and PM dispatch controls. Zen 3+ rely on CPPC for power management, with the kext operating in telemetry-only mode.*

## Helping with New CPU Compatibility

New AMD CPU generations (or steppings within existing families) may require updates to register addresses, temperature offsets, and power management configuration. This data **cannot be guessed** — it must be collected from real hardware.

If you have a CPU that is not yet supported, or if you want to confirm compatibility on a newly released model, please **open a GitHub issue** with diagnostic data.

### How to collect diagnostic data

**Prerequisites**: Python 3 and administrative (sudo) access.

**Important**: For the most useful data, please have `AMDRyzenCPUPowerManagement.kext` loaded and `AMD Power Gadget.app` running for at least 30 seconds before collecting the report. This ensures the kext has initialized, detected your CPU, and populated the sensor data.

If you cannot load the kext (e.g. the CPU is not yet supported), run the script anyway — the data will still help us identify your hardware and add support.

```bash
# 1. Install the kexts and app (or load them via OpenCore)
# 2. Launch AMD Power Gadget and wait ~30 seconds
# 3. Download and run the diagnostic script
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DrogaBox/SMCAMDProcessor-personal/master/Tools/cpu_compat_report.sh
chmod +x cpu_compat_report.sh
sudo ./cpu_compat_report.sh
```

The script generates a report file at `/tmp/cpu_compat_report_<date>.txt`.  
Open a new issue at the link below and **attach the report file**:

👉 **[Open New CPU Compatibility Issue](https://github.com/DrogaBox/SMCAMDProcessor-personal/issues/new?assignees=DrogaBox&labels=cpu-compatibility%2Cdata-needed&template=new-cpu-compatibility.md&title=%5BCPU%5D+AMD+%3CYour+CPU+Model%3E)**

### What information is needed and why

| Data | Why it matters |
|------|---------------|
| **CPUID (Family/Model/Stepping)** | Identifies the exact CPU generation; the kext uses this to select register maps and capabilities |
| **AMD PCI Host Bridge Device ID** | Each Zen generation exposes the SMN (System Management Network) aperture at a different PCI device. Without the correct Device ID, the kext cannot read sensor registers |
| **Package Temperature** | Confirms that the temperature register offset is correct. A wrong offset causes readings that are off by 49 °C |
| **MSR dumps** | Verify CPPC capability bits, P-state register layout, and energy reporting unit encoding |
| **Linux k10temp comparison** | The Linux `k10temp` driver documents the exact temperature register addresses per family. Cross-referencing with macOS confirms the SMN mapping |
| **Kext logs** | Shows whether the kext loaded, which registers it found, and any errors during initialization |
| **Motherboard / SuperIO chip** | Required for fan control support |

### What happens next

1. The CPUID values are added to the [CPU profile table](https://github.com/DrogaBox/SMCAMDProcessor-personal/blob/master/AMDRyzenCPUPowerManagement/AMDRyzenCPUPowerManagement.hpp) as a new `ZenCpuFeatureMap` entry
2. SMU mailbox and SMN registers are mapped (or blocked with logging if unverified)
3. Temperature offset flags are validated
4. A test build is provided for verification
5. Once confirmed working, the CPU is added to the supported list

**Important**: Writing to wrong SMU or SMN addresses can corrupt SMU firmware state and may require a CMOS clear to recover. Until your CPU is explicitly supported, Curve Optimizer and manual P-state writes remain **disabled by design**.

## Installation & OpenCore Setup

### Kext Loading Order
Ensure the kexts are loaded in the exact dependency order in your OpenCore `config.plist`:
1. `Lilu.kext`
2. `VirtualSMC.kext`
3. `AMDRyzenCPUPowerManagement.kext` (Core driver - Required)
4. `SMCAMDProcessor.kext` (VirtualSMC sensor plugin)

### OpenCore Requirements
- OpenCore 0.7.1 or newer.
- AMD Vanilla kernel patches applied.
- `ProvideCurrentCpuInfo` quirk enabled in `config.plist`.
- Boot arguments (recommended for full app control on a personal machine):
  - **`-amdcppcactive`** — CPPC Active Mode / EPP profiles at boot.
  - **`-amdpnopchk`** — allow non-root UserClient **writes** (fans, EPP, CO, …). Without it, monitoring still works; controls need root or show the privilege banner.
  - **`-amdpdbg`** — verbose kext debug logging (troubleshooting only).

See [docs/BOOT_ARGS.md](docs/BOOT_ARGS.md) and [docs/INSTALLATION.md](docs/INSTALLATION.md) for NVRAM setup (`Add` + `Delete` for `boot-args`).

> [!WARNING]
> `-amdpnopchk` is a deliberate security tradeoff: any local process that can open the UserClient may issue privileged hardware writes. Use only on trusted personal systems.

### App install
Copy `AMD Power Gadget.app` to `/Applications`, clear quarantine if needed (`xattr -cr`), launch once and accept the safety disclaimer.  
Language: **Themes & Appearance → Language → Apply & Restart**.

## Why This Matters

### For AMD CPU users on macOS

AMD never had native Apple support. While Intel and Apple Silicon users have power management, temperature sensors, and fan control built into the operating system, AMD users rely entirely on kexts like this one for their system to function properly. Without this driver:

- **No CPU telemetry**: You cannot read temperature, frequency, voltage, or power draw from your processor.
- **No fan control**: Fans either run at 100% constantly or fail to respond to actual temperature.
- **No efficient power management**: The CPU stays at high frequencies at all times, increasing power draw and heat.
- **No VirtualSMC sensors**: Apps like iStat Menus, TG Pro, or HWMonitor cannot read any motherboard sensors.

This software **replaces the entire monitoring and control layer** that Apple should have provided for AMD. Without it, a Ryzentosh is a blind, loud, and inefficient system.

### Why the security update was critical (v3.24.0)

The security audit revealed real issues that could cause anything from silent memory corruption to system instability:

1. **Memory corruption on the hot path** (C1): A 64-bit `lock incq` instruction writing to a 32-bit variable could corrupt adjacent memory. Under heavy load, this caused unpredictable crashes.

2. **SMU mailbox per-family** (C2/C3): SMU (System Management Unit) register addresses change between Zen generations. The original code used hardcoded Zen 3 addresses. Running Curve Optimizer on Zen 4 or Zen 5 would write to wrong registers — worst case, requiring a CMOS clear to recover.

3. **Incomplete MSR blocklist** (M4): Intel-specific MSRs were missing from the blocklist, causing `#GP` (General Protection Fault) on AMD CPUs. A malicious or accidental write could trigger an instant kernel panic.

4. **Insufficient SMU timeout** (H2): The 2ms timeout for Curve Optimizer commands was too short. The SMU needs 5–15ms to reconfigure PLLs, causing the driver to report timeouts while the command was still executing — leaving the SMU in an inconsistent state.

5. **Fragile KASLR reference** (M5): Using `printf` as the reference symbol for KASLR slide computation is dangerous because Apple could remove that symbol from the kernel export set in any update. Switching to `_version` ensures the kext continues working on future macOS releases.

6. **Unverified Zen 5 temperature offset** (H3): The 49°C temperature offset flag was unverified for Zen 5. Applying it blindly could report completely wrong temperatures, causing thermal throttle or fan control to trigger at incorrect thresholds.

7. **Atomicity** (M1, M9): Non-atomic operations on shared counters (`hpcpus`, `kextloadAlerts`) were a time bomb in multi-threaded environments. They worked by chance, not by design.

### Commitment to quality

This personal fork is not just "another update". Every line of kernel code runs in the most privileged space of the operating system — **CPU ring 0**. A bug here does not crash an app, it crashes the entire system. That is why:

- **159 files** were audited line by line.
- **34 findings** were identified across Critical to Low severity.
- **4 Critical** and **7 High** findings were fixed before release.
- Every fix was documented with its technical rationale.

Running CPU management software without these fixes is like driving a car without brakes: it works until it does not.

## What We Removed and Why (v3.31.0)

Every cleanup in this release has the same punchline: **it was Intel code living in an AMD driver.** Like finding a single chopstick in your silverware drawer — it looked like it belonged, but nobody was ever going to use it.

Here is what got the axe and why:

### MWAIT idle strategy (`PMRYZEN_IDLE_STRATEGY_MWAIT`)

**Removed because:** MWAIT/MONITOR is an Intel technology. AMD CPUs support the instruction at the CPUID level for compatibility reasons, but it does **not** actually put the core into a low-power C-state on AMD silicon — it is a no-op that wastes power. The only idle strategy that works on real AMD hardware is `sti; hlt` (SIMPLE). The MWAIT code path was cargo-culted from Intel power management drivers and never served any purpose on Zen.

**The AMD experience:** Having MWAIT in an AMD driver is like installing a cupholder on a motorcycle — technically possible, but you are going to have a bad time.

*(Note for the pedantic: yes, some AMD EPYC server chips support MWAIT extensions. This is a desktop/laptop driver. No, your Ryzen 9 is not an EPYC. We checked.)*

### IO_CSTATE idle path (`pmRyzen_exit_idle()`)

**Removed because:** This was a legacy code path that had been dead since Zen 2. It relied on an I/O port C-state exit sequence that was never correctly implemented for AMD hardware. The function existed, compiled, and did nothing — like a meeting that should have been an email.

### `cppcReadAllowed` / `cppcWriteAllowed` member variables

**Removed because:** Every single CPU profile (Zen 1 through Zen 5) set both to `false`. They were vestigial struct members that had not been true since before Zen 3 Vermeer was a supported CPU. Keeping them around was like carrying a spare key for a car you sold three years ago.

### `telemetryAllowed` → renamed to `cppcReadInInit`

**Removed because (the name):** This variable controlled whether the driver attempted to read CPPC capability registers during `reinitHwState()`. It had nothing to do with telemetry — telemetry always works. The old name was like calling your refrigerator "the warm closet" because technically it is not freezing outside.

### Redundant `cpuArchName` initial block

**Removed because:** The code set `cpuArchName` twice in `start()` — once in an if/else ladder by family/model, and then again from the active CPU profile. The profile always overwrote the first assignment, making the initial block dead code. It was a setup where the first vote gets counted, and then immediately thrown out.

### CPUID MWait leaf logging

**Removed because:** We removed MWAIT support. Logging the MWAIT CPUID leaf after that is like checking the temperature of a stove you already unplugged — technically informative, practically pointless.

### Bottom line

A clean codebase is a happy codebase. Every line you remove is a line that cannot have a bug, cannot confuse a future maintainer, and cannot accidentally do something stupid at 3 AM on a production machine. Also, Intel features in AMD code look weird, like a bagpipe solo at a mariachi wedding.
