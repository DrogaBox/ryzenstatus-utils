# Change Summary & Release Changelog

## v3.23.1 - Audit Fixes

### Fixed
- Added defensive `fProvider` null-guard wrapping all SMC key registrations in `setupKeysVsmc()` (TC0x, PCPR, PSTR, per-CCD). Previously only per-CCD keys were guarded.
- Reduced actor-hop IPC overhead in telemetry sampling — collapsed ~8 individual `await` calls into a single `snapshotTelemetry()` transaction on `ProcessorModel`, cutting context-switch overhead.
- Documented fragile dynamic symbol resolution in `kernel_resolver.h` with explicit risk disclosure.

## v3.33.4 — Codebase Restructure & Audit Hardening

### Codebase Restructure (Phase 1–3)
* **Views/ modularization**: Extracted monolithic SwiftUI views into focused files under `Views/Dashboard/`, `Views/Popover/`, `Views/Shared/`, `Views/Widgets/`, `Views/Config/`.
* **Telemetry/ extraction**: Separated `TelemetryDataTypes.swift`, `HistoryStorage.swift`, and related types from `TelemetryModel.swift`.
* Removed stale refactor scripts and superseded plan/spec docs (`scripts/refactor_*.py`, `docs/superpowers/plans/`).
* Removed dead code from `Views/Shared/` (`BlockWindowDragView`, `VisualEffects`).
* **`.gitattributes`**: Added `merge=union` strategy for `*.pbxproj` files to reduce merge conflicts; marked `MacKernelSDK/**` as `linguist-vendored`.

### Kext (AMDRyzenCPUPowerManagement) — Audit Fixes
* **K-2 — controlLock for provider state writes**: Added dedicated `IOLock *controlLock` to serialize `PStateCtl`, `cppcActiveMode`, and `cppcEPPValue` writes from concurrent UserClient connections. Protects selectors 10, 24, 25 against races between the timer workLoop and multiple UserClient callers.
* **K-3 — Atomic kextAlertDisplayed clear**: Replaced non-atomic `kextAlertDisplayed = 0` with `OSCompareAndSwap(1, 0, ...)` to prevent race between the clear and another thread's atomic check-and-set.
* **B-1 — Privilege re-validation**: `hasPrivilege()` now re-validates `proc_suser` on every call instead of using a cached flag. Removed `clientAuthorizedByUser` dead code. Stores `fOwningTask` from `initWithTask` (replaces `getTask()` which is unavailable in IOUserClient kext context).
* Removed internal audit tracking codes (K-01, S-01, P-01) from source comments.

### App (AMD Power Gadget)
* **U-5 — Async flushToDisk**: Moved `HistoryManager.shared.flushToDisk()` from synchronous termination callback into a `Task { }` block to prevent blocking the main thread during app termination.

---

## v3.32.0 — Temperature Offset Flag & Documentation Update

### Kext (AMDRyzenCPUPowerManagement)
* **temperatureOffset49 per-profile flag**: Added `temperatureOffset49` field to `ZenCpuFeatureMap` profile struct, moving the 49°C offset from a kext-wide constant to a per-CPU-profile capability. Enabled for all Zen 1–4 profiles (verified against hardware), disabled for Zen 5 pending PPR validation. Eliminates the hardware flag bit check on architectures that do not support it.

### App (AMD Power Gadget)
* **Removed dead code**: Cleaned up `ResizableChart` unused methods and properties.

### Documentation
* Updated README supported processors table and ARCHITECTURE.md with current Zen family coverage.
* User manuals (EN + ES) updated to v3.31.0; removed stale PDF versions.
* Added "What We Removed and Why" section to README.

---

## v3.30.0 Kext Idle Strategy, KASLR Anchor, SMU Barrier & Weak Self Fix

### Kext (AMDRyzenCPUPowerManagement)
* **Runtime Idle Strategy**: Replaced compile-time `#ifdef` idle strategy (`PMRYZEN_IDLE_SIMPLE`/`MWAIT`) with runtime selection via `pmRyzen_idle_strategy` global + `switch`. Zen 4/5 (Family 19h ≥60h, Family 1Ah) automatically use `MONITOR/MWAIT` for lower idle power draw; Zen 3- continue with safe `sti;hlt`. No more `#error` guards or rebuilds needed when CPU family changes.
* **KASLR Slide Dual-Anchor**: Added `_mh_execute_header` as the primary KASLR slide anchor (stable Mach-O header symbol), with `&version` as fallback. Both validated against canonical kernel range `>= 0xFFFFFF8000000000`. The old single-anchor approach relied only on `&version` which could be removed from the kernel export set.
* **SMU Mailbox Memory Barrier**: Inserted `__asm__ volatile("mfence" ::: "memory")` between `smnWrite32(msgReg, cmd)` and the response poll loop in `smuSendCmd`. Prevents write-combining buffers on the SMN bus from delaying command delivery, which could cause spurious timeouts in the poll path.

### App (AMD Power Gadget)
* **Weak Self in Task Closures**: Added `[weak self]` + `guard let self` to all 3 remaining `Task { @MainActor }` closures in `TelemetryModel.swift` (`init()`, `sample()`, `commitPendingChanges()`). Prevents the tasks from prolonging the TelemetryModel singleton lifetime when they outlive the object.

---

## v3.29.0 Code Quality & Formatting Refactor

### App (AMD Power Gadget)
* **Format Function Extraction**: Extracted `formatBytes()` to `ChartHelpers.swift`, removing 4 duplicated `formatSpeed()` implementations across the codebase. Centralized formatting logic for maintainability.
* **Bug Fixes**: Resolved popover graph misalignment by removing ZStack wrapper in popover views.

---

## v3.28.0 Fan Model Refactor & Sensor Enum

### App (AMD Power Gadget)
* **Fan Model Extraction**: Extracted fan models into dedicated files, added `FanSensor` enum for type-safe sensor handling.
* **processSampleData() Refactor**: Refactored the main sampling pipeline helpers for better separation of concerns.

---

## v3.27.0 Popover Graph Alignment Fix

### App (AMD Power Gadget)
* **Graph Alignment Fix**: Fixed popover graph misalignment by removing the ZStack wrapper that was causing layout offset.
* **Loading Overlay Removal**: Removed popover loading overlay that was interfering with proper graph rendering.

---

## v3.26.0 Popover Loading Indicator

### App (AMD Power Gadget)
* **Loading State UX**: Added loading indicator to popover views for better user feedback during data sampling.
* **Version Bump**: Incremented version to track popover UI improvements.

---

## v3.25.0 ProcessorModel Actor Conversion & Privilege Logging

### Kext (AMDRyzenCPUPowerManagement)
* **Kext Privilege Logging**: Enhanced privilege check logging for better debugging of UserClient authorization flow.

### App (AMD Power Gadget)
* **ProcessorModel Actor Conversion**: Converted `ProcessorModel` to Swift actor for improved thread safety and concurrency handling.
* **UI Improvements**: General UI refinements across dashboard and settings views.

---

## v3.24.0 Security Audit Hardening & Per-Family CPU Support

### Kext (AMDRyzenCPUPowerManagement) - Critical Security Fixes
* **C1 - Atomic Instruction Fix**: Fixed `lock incq/decq` operating on `uint32_t pmRyzen_hpcpus` (64-bit op on 32-bit variable) by switching to `lock incl/decl`. This prevented latent memory corruption in the hot idle path that could corrupt adjacent variables (`pmRyzen_pstatelimit`).
* **C2/C3 - Per-Family SMU Mailbox Descriptor**: Implemented family-aware SMU mailbox register addresses and command IDs:
  - **Zen 3 (Family 19h, Models 21h-2Fh)**: SMU mailbox at `0x3B10524/28/2C`, Curve Optimizer command `0x3D` (supported, enabled)
  - **Zen 4 (Family 19h, Models 60h-7Fh)**: SMU mailbox addresses unverified; Curve Optimizer blocked with logging until AGESA validation
  - **Zen 5 (Family 1Ah)**: SMU mailbox completely unsupported; Curve Optimizer disabled to prevent SMU firmware corruption
* **H2 - SMU Timeout Tuning**: Increased SMU command poll timeout from 2ms to 50ms specifically for Curve Optimizer (`0x3D`), which triggers PLL reconfiguration taking 5–15ms on Zen 3. Added mailbox reset sequence on timeout to prevent stale state inheritance.
* **H3 - Zen 5 Temperature Offset Safety**: Disabled the 49°C temperature offset on Zen 5 (Family 1Ah) until verified against Granite Ridge PPR. Added one-time logging to surface the discrepancy to users; offset remains enabled for Zen 1–4 where validated.
* **H1 - MWAIT Idle Path Fix**: Added missing `sti` instruction after MWAIT exit to re-enable interrupts. MWAIT paths are currently disabled via `#undef PMRYZEN_IDLE_MWAIT`, but this fix prevents latent scheduler hangs if MWAIT is re-enabled on future Zen 1/2 profiles.
* **M4 - Expanded Intel MSR Blocklist**: Expanded MSR bounds checking to block additional Intel-exclusive MSRs that cause `#GP` on AMD:
  - `0xE2` (IA32_POWER_CTL — Intel layout mismatch)
  - `0x1AD` (IA32_ENERGY_PERF_BIAS — Intel EPB, AMD uses `0xC00102B3`)
  - `0x345` (IA32_PERF_LIMIT_REASONS — Intel-only)
  - `0x610–0x617` (Intel RAPL PL1/PL2/PL3 + status registers)
* **M5 - KASLR Slide Symbol Stabilization**: Replaced fragile `printf` symbol reference (libc shim, may be removed from kernel export set) with stable `&version` symbol for kernel base address calculation. `printf` was a probe-time liability; `_version` has been in the kernel export set since XNU 10.4.
* **M8 - P1 Frequency Ratio Configuration**: Made P1 P-state frequency ratio configurable via boot-arg `amdpp1ratio=XX` (default 80). Allows tuning base-clock frequency without recompilation:
  - `-amdpp1ratio=75` → P1 = 75% of P0
  - `-amdpp1ratio=85` → P1 = 85% of P0
  - Defaults to 80% if unspecified or out-of-range (> 100%)
* **M9 - Atomic Increment**: Changed `kextloadAlerts++` to `OSIncrementAtomic()` to eliminate non-atomic read-modify-write race condition (unlikely to occur in practice given single-instantiation, but now correct by design).
* **H7 - SMN PCI Control Register Per-Family**: Added family-aware selection for SMN aperture control register:
  - Zen 1–4: PCI config offset `0x60` (legacy)
  - Zen 5: PCI config offset `0x60` (unverified — placeholder pending PPR validation)
  - Improved future extensibility when SMN aperture moves on next-gen architectures.
* **L7 - Constant Usage**: Replaced hardcoded loop bound `16` with `kMAX_FANS` constant to prevent accidental misalignment if `kMAX_FANS` definition changes.

### Kernel Resolution & Symbol Handling
* **kernel_resolver.c**: Migrated KASLR slide computation from `printf` to `&version` for stability and future-proofing.

### SuperIO Driver Improvements
* **M3 - ITE Port Closure**: Fixed incomplete port closure in `ISSuperIOIT86XXEFamily.cpp`; now correctly closes both ITE 0x2E (`0x02` sequence) and 0x4E (`0xAA` sequence) ports to prevent LPC bus interference with other drivers (e.g., `appleSMC.kext`, `VirtualSMC.kext`).

### App (AMD Power Gadget) - UX & Reliability
* **H5 - Launch Helper Robustness**: Replaced fragile 4-level directory-walk path traversal with `NSWorkspace.shared.urlForApplication(withBundleIdentifier:)` lookup. APGLaunchHelper now dynamically resolves the main app's path by bundle ID instead of assuming fixed install layout. Removed debug `print("hello world")` leftover.
* **M11 - Helper Bundle ID Configuration**: Made APGLaunchHelper bundle ID dynamic by reading from Info.plist key `APGLaunchHelperBundleID` instead of hardcoding. Decouples main app from helper's bundle ID, allowing easier rebranding or restructuring.
* **L2 - Package Power Naming**: Renamed `uniPackageEnergy` → `uniPackagePowerW` to clarify that the variable holds average **power** (watts, energy delta / time delta), not cumulative energy. Fixes semantic mismatch between variable naming and computed value across 6 references.

### Build System & Versioning
* **H4 - Dynamic Bundle Versioning**: Updated both kext and app Info.plist files to use `$(CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION)` and `$(MARKETING_VERSION)` build variables instead of hardcoded `7` and `3.23.3`. Fixes macOS update versioning and Spotlight indexing; now respects `Config/Version.xcconfig` as single source of truth.
* **H6 - Kext Dependency Versioning**: Updated `OSBundleCompatibleVersion` from `0.6` to `3.16.0` to prevent incompatible kext pairs from loading. Kernel now enforces that `SMCAMDProcessor.kext` requires `AMDRyzenCPUPowerManagement.kext >= 3.16.0`, avoiding crashes from struct layout mismatches.
* **L1 - CHANGELOG Documentation**: Corrected CPU family naming from "Family 1Bh" (future arch) to "Family 1Ah" (Zen 5 Granite Ridge).

### Validation & Testing
* **Compile-time Assertion**: Added `#error` guard in `pmAMDRyzen.h` to ensure exactly one idle strategy (`PMRYZEN_IDLE_MWAIT` / `PMRYZEN_IDLE_SIMPLE` / `PMRYZEN_IDLE_IO_CSTATE`) is active per build. Prevents accidental dual-definition bugs.
* **Fan Curve Input Validation**: Tightened fan curve UserClient input validation from `< 272` to `== sizeof(FanCurveInput)` to reject oversized payloads early.

### Compatibility & Future-Proofing
* **M6 - Fan Curve Struct Validation**: Moved `FanCurveInput` struct definition before size check to enable compile-time `sizeof` validation instead of magic number `272`.
* Full backward compatibility maintained with Zen 1–5; telemetry operational on all supported architectures.
* Zen 4/5 Curve Optimizer writes remain disabled until SMU/SMN addresses are validated against official AGESA PPRs.

## v3.23.2 Vermeer PM Dispatch Decouple
* **Kernel**: Disabled PM Dispatch takeover (`pmDispatchAllowed = false`) for Vermeer/Cezanne CPUs, reverting to safe baseline telemetry. 
  * **Architectural Context**: In legacy architectures (Zen 1 / Zen 2), the Kext was required to manually inject P-States because macOS lacked native AMD power management. However, modern processors like Vermeer (Zen 3) are now fully capable of native CPPC power management via modern macOS AMD Vanilla patches. 
  * By decoupling the Kext's legacy manual overrides for Zen 3, we prevent severe race conditions and `#GP` kernel panics caused by the Kext and macOS's native XCPM competing for MSR frequency control. The Kext now safely acts purely as a telemetry observer on modern CPUs, allowing macOS to natively drive stability and idle power scaling.

## v3.23.1 Expanded Zen 3+ Kernel Safety

### Kext (AMDRyzenCPUPowerManagement)
* **Future-Proof MSR Filtering**: Expanded the strict Intel MSR bounds checking from Zen 3 (`Family 19h`) to Zen 4 (`Family 19h Model 60h`) and Zen 5 (`Family 1Ah`) architectures (`cpuFamily >= 0x19`). This proactively protects all newer AMD CPUs from `#GP` kernel panics when accessing unsupported MSRs.

## v3.23.0 Zen 3 Kernel Safety Update

### Kext (AMDRyzenCPUPowerManagement)
* **Safe Idle Loop**: Enforced `PMRYZEN_IDLE_SIMPLE` (`sti; hlt`) on AMD Zen 3 to prevent `#UD` (Illegal Instruction) kernel panics caused by incompatible `MONITOR/MWAIT` usage.
* **MSR Bounds Checking**: Implemented strict hardware verification for Ryzen 5000 (`Family 19h`). Unsafe read/write operations to Intel-exclusive MSRs (like `MSR_PLATFORM_INFO` or `MSR_IA32_MISC_ENABLE`) are now actively blocked to prevent `#GP` (General Protection) faults.
* **Kext Version Sync**: Unified versioning and automated dual-distribution for both App and Kext binaries in the release pipeline.

## v3.22.0 Advanced UI Performance Engine & Memory Safety

### App (AMD Power Gadget)
* **Performance Optimization Framework**: Introduced a suite of high-performance SwiftUI utilities including `@ThresholdPublished` to aggressively throttle unnecessary UI redraws.
* **Smart Chart Rendering**: Implemented `trackVisibility()` modifier and `CalculationCache` with TTL, ensuring graphs are only computed and rendered when visible on-screen.
* **Diagnostics & Profiling**: Added `PerformanceMonitor` to track average sample times and peak memory usage, alongside `DiagnosticsHelper` for reliable system state capture via `NSLog`.
* **Memory Safety Mechanisms**: Enforced strict resource cleanup with explicit `deinit` blocks in `StatusbarController` to safely remove global `NSEvent` monitors and prevent severe memory leaks.
* **Actor Isolation Refinements**: Perfected the weak capture pattern in asynchronous `@MainActor` task execution for `fetchTopProcesses`, completely sealing the remaining retain cycles.

## v3.21.0 Massive UI Refactor & Modularization

### App (AMD Power Gadget)
* **Codebase Modularization**: Completely dismantled the monolithic `StatusbarController.swift` (removing over 1700 lines) and `MainDashboardView.swift`. Extracted components into over 15 distinct, highly reusable, and lightweight SwiftUI files (`DashboardTab`, `SystemInfoViews`, `ChartComponents`, `ThemeViews`, etc.).
* **Build Performance**: The new component-based architecture allows the Swift compiler to process files in parallel, drastically reducing build times and improving maintainability.
* **Automated Project Integration**: Leveraged Ruby scripts to perfectly integrate the new file hierarchy into the Xcode `.pbxproj` dynamically.
* **Zero-Defect Refactor**: The entire extraction was executed flawlessly without introducing a single compilation error or broken reference.

## v3.20.0  Swift Concurrency Engine

### App (AMD Power Gadget)
* **Swift Concurrency Migration**: Migrated the entire underlying polling and rendering engine from legacy GCD (`DispatchQueue`) to native Swift 6 Concurrency (`Task`, `actor`, and `@MainActor`).
* **NetworkStats Actor**: Rewrote the network interface monitor as an `actor`, eliminating race conditions and manual queues.
* **Asynchronous Telemetry**: The main telemetry loop now polls asynchronously, completely decoupling heavy kernel IO tasks from the UI frame rendering.
* **Memory Safety & Leaks**: Fixed a critical memory retain cycle in `fetchTopProcesses` background polling by ensuring static invocation, preventing the task from holding onto the `TelemetryModel` view model indefinitely.
* **UI Alignments**: Corrected sidebar label truncation and layout distortions introduced by overly long localized strings.

## v3.19.4  UI Hotfixes for Dashboard (Minor)
* Fixed button scaling and alignment on the dashboard.


## v3.19.3  Desktop Widgets Grid-Snapping & UI Polish

### App (AMD Power Gadget)
* **Magnetic Grid-Snapping (Desktop Widgets)**: Completely redesigned the `NSWindow` foundation for Desktop Widgets. Dragging widgets across the screen now automatically intercepts window coordinates and snaps them to a 20x20 pixel magnetic grid, perfectly replicating native macOS desktop icon alignment behavior.

## v3.19.2  Liquid Glass NSPanel Migration

### App (AMD Power Gadget)
* **NSPanel Migration**: Removed all legacy `NSPopover` implementations to permanently resolve `NSISEngine` recursive layout crashes in SwiftUI. The dashboard now runs on a custom borderless `.nonactivatingPanel` that perfectly inherits Tahoe's Liquid Glass materials.
* **Native Core Animations**: Restored the missing fade and slide animations from the `NSPopover` days by manually wrapping the `NSPanel` frame adjustments and opacity changes in `NSAnimationContext.runAnimationGroup` with `easeOut` / `easeIn` interpolations.

## v3.19.1  UI Refinements, Telemetry Optimizations & UX Fixes

### App (AMD Power Gadget)
* **Background Polling Optimization (Light Mode)**: Drastically reduced CPU and SMC overhead when only the status bar is visible. The telemetry engine now dynamically skips heavy PCI, NVMe, and CCD hardware queries for any metrics (GPU, RAM, Disk, Fans) that the user has chosen to hide from the menu bar, provided CSV logging is disabled.
* **Popover Native Aesthetics**: Removed custom clipping and dual borders from the popover window to let macOS natively render the glassmorphism and arrow stroke (fixing the double-border artifact).
* **StatusBar Uptime & Battery**: Integrated real-time Battery (or AC status) and System Uptime directly into the MenuBarPopover header.
* **Configuration Persistence**: Architecturally decoupled `popoverRingOrder` from the vertical item lists to resolve persistence and configuration bugs where "Top Processes" or Network cards wouldn't load or respect user ordering.
* **Context Menu Decoupling**: Moved context menus out of the main telemetry tick loops into standalone `Equatable` views with stable IDs, completely resolving right-click flickering.
* **Sidebar Relocation**: Moved GitHub, Donate, and Updates buttons to the left sidebar for cleaner layout.

## v3.19.0  Tahoe UI Overhaul, Liquid Glass & Interactive Menus

### App (AMD Power Gadget)
* **Premium Liquid Glass UI**: Massive visual overhaul integrating macOS Tahoe-style `vibrantDark` glassmorphism, translucent card backgrounds (0.15 opacity), and smooth visual effects across the entire dashboard.
* **Interactive MenuBar Popover**: Introduced KDE-style interactive tabs and profiles inside the status bar popover. 
* **Dynamic Dashboard Ordering**: Added support for fully customizable dashboard ring item ordering and individual context menu sizing.
* **Caffeinate Manager**: Integrated system sleep prevention (Caffeinate) toggles directly into the UI.
* **Optional Memory Card**: Added a new RAM usage ring/dashboard card.
* **Preferences Redesign**: Complete overhaul of the Settings view with a premium layout, preset shortcut selectors, and better organization.


## v3.18.4  Hotfix: rendezvousLock deadlock fix

### Critical Fix
* **Boot hang / kernel deadlock**: `rendezvousLock` `IOLockUnlock()` was placed outside the timer callback in `initWorkLoop()`. The lock was taken on every telemetry tick but never released inside the callback — the second tick deadlocked the `IOWorkLoop`, causing a kernel hang at boot. Fix: moved `IOLockUnlock()` inside the callback, right after the last protected-state access. Lock/unlock now balanced 6:6, all within the same scope.

### Verified
* All six rendezvous call sites balanced (init, telemetry tick, applyPowerControl, applyEPPControl, setCPBState, writePstate).
* Build verified: kext + app + SMCAMDPlugin compile clean on macOS 26 Tahoe SDK, x86_64 target.


## v3.18.4  Kernel hardening P2-3…P2-8, rendezvousLock, post-sleep lag fix

### Critical Fix
* **Post-sleep system lag**: `resumeWorkLoop()` was blocking the IOKit Power Management thread with ~128 synchronous MSR reads (`reinitHwState()` + `dumpPstate()`) during S3 wake. Root cause: all hardware re-probe work ran inline on the PM thread — same thread macOS uses to complete the wake sequence and restore interactive use. Fix: `resumeWorkLoop()` now sets `pendingReinit = true` and schedules the timer at 250 ms; the first workLoop-thread tick calls `reinitHwState()` and returns — completely off the PM thread. Timer was also changed from 1 ms to 250 ms post-wake to give the system time to finish its own wake sequence before the kext starts rendezvous / MSR writes.

### Kernel (AMDRyzenCPUPowerManagement.kext)
* **P2-3 SMU Response codes**: `SMUResponse` enum (`SMU_RSP_OK/INVALID_CMD/INVALID_ARGS/BUSY/TIMEOUT`) documents all SMU mailbox return codes. `setCurveOptimizer` maps them to distinct `int` rc values; UserClient selector 111 translates these to `kIOReturnTimeout`, `kIOReturnUnsupported`, `kIOReturnBadArgument`, `kIOReturnBusy`, or `kIOReturnError` so the Swift UI can show specific error messages.
* **P2-4 Post-wake `reinitHwState()`**: Extracted CPB (`CPUID 80000007h`), CPPC (MSR `0xC00102B0` + CPUID fallback), RAPL unit MSR, and P-state dump into `reinitHwState()`. Called from `start()` (boot) and deferred via `pendingReinit` on S3 wake (see Critical Fix above).
* **P2-5 Kernel resolver safety**: `vm_kernel_unslide_or_perm_external` result validated against `slide_address != 0` before computing KASLR base. `find_mach_header_addr` load-command walk now bounds-checked against `sizeofcmds`. `find_symbol` iteration bounds-checked against `symtab_end`.
* **P2-6 Fan curve `deltaTime`**: Default step duration changed from hardcoded `0.5` s to `HF_TEMP_SAMPLE_PERIOD / 1000.0` (matches actual timer period).
* **P2-7 Fan array compile-time assertions**: `kMAX_FANS = 16` constant + three `static_assert` guards so any array-size mismatch between `fanToCurveMap`, `lastAppliedPWM`, and `lastPWMUpdateTime` causes a build error.
* **`rendezvousLock`** (new `IOLock`): Serializes all `mp_rendezvous` / `mp_rendezvous_no_intrs` call sites (init work loop, `applyPowerControl`, `applyEPPControl`, `setCPBState`, `writePstate`) preventing concurrent per-core MSR rendezvous races. Allocated in `init()`, freed in both `stop()` and `free()`. Correctly accessed as `provider->rendezvousLock` inside no-capture IOKit timer lambdas.
* **`fProvider` / `wentToSleep` default init**: Both members default-initialized in header to avoid undefined-value UB on early teardown paths.
* **`free()` cleanup**: `pciConfigLock`, `superIOLock`, `smuCmdLock`, `rendezvousLock`, and `fIOPCIDevice` are all released/freed in `free()` (in addition to `stop()`) so resources aren't leaked if `start()` fails after `init()`.

### App (AMD Power Gadget)
* **P-State loop bound** (`ProcessorModel.swift`): `while i < PStateDef.count` replaces hardcoded `while i < 8` preventing out-of-bounds access.
* **Notifications guard** (`TelemetryModel.swift`): `didSet` on `notificationsEnabled` guards `guard oldValue != newValue` to break the permission-callback re-assignment infinite loop.

### LaunchHelper (APGLaunchHelper)
* **P3-3 Modern entry point**: `main.swift` migrated from legacy `NSApplicationMain(CommandLine.argc, CommandLine.unsafeArgv)` C call to `NSApplication.shared.run()`. `AppDelegate` instantiated as a `private let` before the run loop.

### Build / CI
* **P2-8**: `scripts/check-format.sh` — `clang-format --dry-run --Werror` dry-run format check script for CI integration.

### Tests
* **P3-6 `SMUResponseMappingTests`**: New XCTest class covering SMU `kIOReturn*` code mapping and Curve Optimizer offset clamping ([-30, +30]).





### Fixes
* **CPPC false “no support”**: Zen family (17h/19h/1Ah) and CAP1 MSR detection so CPUs like 5900XT no longer show *“This CPU did not report CPPC support”* while Active Mode works. `-amdcppcactive` behavior unchanged.
* **Core-grid HUD toggles**: Temp / Freq / Load labels no longer wrap mid-word in Spanish (and other locales); header controls use a dedicated non-compressing row.
* **Menu bar i18n** (3.18.x trunk): Max Freq Only / Fahrenheit + descriptions localized (IT/ES).



## v3.18.0  Chart style i18n fix, CPPC badge clarity, unit tests in CI

### UI / localization (critical)
* **Chart styles**: Stable English UserDefaults keys (`Smooth Curves`, `Filled Area`, `Column Bars`, `Line Only`). Legacy Spanish prefs are normalized and **rewritten at launch**.
* **CPPC badge vs EPP toggle**: Core-grid badge shows `CPPC: HW OK` / `CPPC: EPP On` / `CPPC: Estimated` with help text. Profiles card explains that a green HW OK badge is **not** Active Mode and points to `-amdpnopchk` when the switch snaps back.
* **EN/ES strings** for new CPPC help copy; deprecated `CPPC: Active` maps to HW OK.

### Themes & telemetry (from 3.17.x trunk)
* RTL-aligned theme presets (Classic / Midnight / Ember / Matrix / Rose) and live menu-bar popover rebuild.
* Refresh-rate slider always honored; lighter GPU/fan/history sampling when only the menu bar is active.

### Quality
* **AMDPowerGadgetTests** Xcode unit-test target wired (`@testable import AMD_Power_Gadget`); CI runs `xcodebuild test` on the Gadget scheme.
* Chart-style migration unit tests.

### Packaging
* CD continues to ship a single flat `SMCAMD-<ver>-Release.zip` (no nested `build/Build/Products`).

## v3.17.0  Audit v2 residual hardening (R-1 … R-8)

Implements non-blocking residual items from the post-3.16.2 source audit.

### Kernel (R-1, R-3, R-6, R-8)
* **R-1 SuperIO UserClient races**: Cases 90–99 now take `superIOLock` around all null-check + `getNumberOfFans` / string / RPM / control paths (case 92 copies label under lock). Prevents theoretical UAF if `initSuperIO` races concurrent reads.
* **R-3 Effective frequency**: `calculateEffectiveFrequency` returns early when `PStateDefClock_perCore[0] <= 0` so cores are not reported as 0 MHz from a zero P0 base.
* **R-6 kunc_alert once**: `kextAlertDisplayed` is `SInt32` with `OSCompareAndSwap` so concurrent UserClient connections cannot double-show the modal.
* **R-8 SMU command lock**: New `smuCmdLock` serializes the full `smuSendCmd` mailbox sequence (clear → arg → msg → poll).

### App (R-2, R-7)
* **R-7 Language relaunch**: `AppLanguage.relaunchApp` calls `TelemetryModel.commitPendingChanges()` (kext curves/mappings, dirty P-States, history flush) and delays terminate 100 ms after `open -n`.
* **R-2 Force-unwraps**: Safer `if let` / guards in `FanCurve.generateLUT`, `GraphView`, history path, fan-curve canvas path.

### Tests (R-5)
* Added `AMDPowerGadgetTests/PrivilegeAndFanCurveTests.swift` (privilege hint, empty LUT, PStateRow zero, AppLanguage). Sources still need an Xcode test target to run in CI.

## v3.16.2  Language picker, privilege UX, SuperIO latency & i18n packaging

### UI & localization
* **In-app language picker** (`AppLanguage.swift`): Themes & Appearance → Language. Options: System Default or any bundled locale (`en`, `es`, `de`, `it`, `fr`, …). Stored as `app_language_code`; applied at launch via `AppleLanguages`. Changing language prompts **Apply & Restart** (not hot-switch).
* **Package all `*.lproj`**: Expanded Xcode `knownRegions` and `Localizable.strings` variant group so every localization is copied into the app bundle for the picker.
* **Crowdin**: `crowdin.yml` maps regional codes (`es-ES` / `es-419` → `es.lproj`, zh/pt/sv variants). Local helper scripts under `scripts/crowdin-*.sh` (credentials via gitignored `.crowdin-credentials`). Full Spanish + completed DE/IT strings in the 3.16 line.
* **Theme editor**: Opening Themes no longer forces the preset to Custom when normalizing `#RRGGBB` → `#AARRGGBB`; opacity slider refreshes live.

### Privilege UX & kernel polish
* **Privilege denial banner**: When UserClient writes return `kIOReturnNotPrivileged`, the dashboard shows an orange banner with guidance (run as root or use `-amdpnopchk`) instead of silent control failures. Control state is reloaded from the kext.
* **Speed Step / saved controls**: `setPState` returns IOKit status; Speed Step and restore-on-launch paths report privilege denials and do not stick UI on failed writes. Auto-EPP and auto-fan curve also surface denials.
* **NCT668X SuperIO lock latency**: Replaced long `IOSleep(2)` under `superIOLock` with short `IODelay` to reduce scheduler hold time during multi-step I/O.
* **kunc_alert once per cycle**: Kext load / alert modal is shown at most once until cleared, avoiding spam on every telemetry poll.
* **GPU temp inject clamp** + reject invalid UserClient selectors (defensive).

### Documentation
* Added full `docs/` set: installation, boot-args (EN/ES), privilege model (EN/ES), features (EN/ES), troubleshooting (EN/ES), architecture, Crowdin/i18n; manuals updated to 3.16.x privilege + language sections.
* README privilege wording corrected (process name is audit-only, not authorization).

## v3.16.1  UserClient Connection Fix (menu-bar compatibility)
* **P0-1 regression fix**: `initWithTask` no longer returns `false` for non-root clients. Rejecting the connection broke `IOServiceOpen` for the normal-user menu bar app and surfaced a false **"No AMDRyzenCPUPowerManagement Found!"** dialog even though the kext was loaded.
* **Correct privilege model**: Any process may open the UserClient for **read-only telemetry**. Write selectors (P-state / CPB / PPM / LPM / CPPC / EPP / fan override / raw SuperIO / fan curves / Curve Optimizer) still require root or `-amdpnopchk` via `hasPrivilege()`.
* Process name is logged for audit only and is **never** used for authorization.

## v3.16.0  Security Hardening, Kernel Correctness & Defensive Resilience

### Security & Safety (P0 — from v3.16.0-rc1)
* **P0-1 UserClient Authorization (root-only)**: Removed the insecure process-name bypass (`AMD Power Gadget` / `SMCAMDProcessor` string match). Connections now require root (`proc_suser`) or the explicit debug boot-arg `-amdpnopchk`. Rejected connections log PID and binary name.
* **P0-2 SuperIO UAF Race**: Wrapped `initSuperIO()` and `evaluateFanCurves()` with `superIOLock`, double-checking `superIO != nullptr` after lock acquisition to prevent use-after-free against concurrent UserClient calls.
* **P0-3 Thermal Guard Ordering**: Moved the 85 °C / 80 % PWM thermal floor **after** hysteresis and ramp-rate limiting so the safety PWM can never be overwritten. Named constants: `kTHERMAL_GUARD_TEMP_C`, `kTHERMAL_GUARD_PWM`, `kTHERMAL_THROTTLE_*`, `kCURVE_OPTIMIZER_BLOCK_TEMP_C`.

### Kernel & App Correctness (P1 — from v3.16.0-rc2)
* **P1-1 P-State FID Clamp**: Clamped computed P1 FID to `0xFF` and require P0 enabled + non-zero DfsId before writing (`pmAMDRyzen.c`).
* **P1-2 CCD Detection**: Probe CCDs via valid-bit (`kZEN_CCD_TEMP_VALID_BIT`) instead of `t > 0`, so cold-boot detection works below ambient-positive false negatives.
* **P1-3 Provider Capture**: `externalMethod` snapshots `fProvider` into a local pointer for the entire switch.
* **P1-4 CPUID Brand Null-Termination**: Explicit `nameString[48] = '\0'` after brand CPUID leaves.
* **P1-5 Fan Counter Snapshot**: Removed strict-aliasing `OSAddAtomic` cast on `fanUpdateCounter` in selector 94.
* **P1-6 Safe URL Opens**: Replaced force-unwrapped `URL(string:)!` call sites with guarded opens in AppDelegate / ProcessorModel / MainDashboardView.
* **P1-7 PCI Accessor Guards**: Null/lock guards on `getCCDTemp`, package temp, and SMN accessors.
* **P1-8 SMC Key Index Bounds**: `KeyTCx*` helpers clamp index against `MaxIndexCount`.

### Defensive Hardening (P2)
* **P2-1 NetworkStats**: Replaced magic ASCII byte compares with `hasPrefix("en"|"bond"|"bridge")`.
* **P2-3 SMU Response Codes**: Documented `SMUResponse` enum; `setCurveOptimizer` returns distinct codes; UserClient selector 111 maps them to `kIOReturnTimeout` / `Unsupported` / `BadArgument` / `Busy`.
* **P2-4 Post-Wake Reinit**: Extracted `reinitHwState()` (CPB/CPPC/RAPL/P-states) and call it from `start()` and `resumeWorkLoop()`.
* **P2-5 Symbol Resolver**: Validate `vm_kernel_unslide_or_perm_external` slide address and kernel canonical range before walking Mach-O headers.
* **P2-6 Fan Curve deltaTime**: Use `HF_TEMP_SAMPLE_PERIOD` instead of hardcoded `0.5` seconds.
* **P2-7 Fan Array Size Asserts**: `kMAX_FANS` + `static_assert` on curve/PWM arrays.
* **P2-8 Format Check Script**: Added `scripts/check-format.sh` (clang-format dry-run).

### Cleanup (P3)
* Scratch diagnostic binaries (`dump_sio`, `write_sio`) ignored; sources retained.
* NCT668X `getReadableStringForFan` returns per-index labels instead of a single `"Fan"` stub.
* Italian (`it`) added to known localization regions in the Xcode project.

## v3.15.0  Bidirectional Curve Optimizer, Standalone Telemetry Daemon & Startup Disclaimer
* **Bidirectional Curve Optimizer (`[-30, +30]`)**: Extended the Curve Optimizer boundary checks in the kernel driver and the GUI sliders to support the full official AMD range of `[-30, +30]` counts. Centered the UI slider layouts at `0` (default native BIOS behavior), highlighting undervolts in Purple and overvolts in Orange. Locked the entire control card behind a persistent safety lock switch.
* **HUD Live Telemetry Grid**: Positioned real-time core frequency (MHz), load (%), and CCD temperature (mapping cores to `CCD0` / `CCD1`) inside each core grid cell. Added checkbox toggles on the dashboard header allowing users to show/hide Freq, Temp, and Load HUD details dynamically.
* **Standalone Background Daemon (`amdtelemetryd`)**: Designed and installed a Swift CLI telemetry daemon as a persistent LaunchAgent (`wtf.spinach.amdtelemetryd.plist`). The daemon collects metrics and appends them to the JSONL history file when the GUI is closed, and automatically bypasses logging when it detects the main GUI app running to prevent database write conflicts.
* **First-Launch Disclaimer Gatekeeper**: Integrated a Liquid Glass modal safety agreement overlay on the very first launch, blocking main window access until the user checks an acceptance checkmark and presses "Accept & Continue" (with a "Quit" alternative to exit).
* **Kernel & App Stability Hardening**: Fixed division-by-zero crashes on Zen 3 initialization and average load calculations, repaired a type mismatch in cpu_IPI interrupts, null-checked symtable resolves and UserClient providers, added bounds protection to inline helpers, eliminated swift force-unwraps on CPU counts and empty paths, and protected against `statusItem.button` AppKit unwrapping failures.

## v3.14.6  Next-Gen Custom Fan Curves & Raw Register Diagnostics
* **Advanced Custom Fan Curve Engine**: Implemented next-generation closed-loop fan curves evaluated directly in the kernel space (kext) using a 256-step LUT, Exponential Moving Average (EMA) smoothing, custom hysteresis, and ramp rate limiting. Includes an 85°C thermal safety guard bypass.
* **Interactive 2D Graph Editor**: Built a Tahoe-themed SwiftUI coordinate-mapped canvas letting users drag points, double-click to add/delete points, and map individual fans to curves.
* **Added Raw Register Access Selectors**: Implemented user-space connection selectors 98 (read raw register) and 99 (write raw register) in `AMDRyzenCPUPMUserClient.cpp`.
* **Created ITE Chip Diagnostic Utilities**: Compiled `/Users/droga/Desktop/SMCAMDProcessor/scratch/dump_sio` and `write_sio` binaries to allow scanning the entire 256-byte register map and modifying configurations to identify alternative fan mappings on ASUS Crosshair VII Hero.
* **Acoustics & Usability Polish**: Fixed macOS window dragging propagation on point drags and overlapping grid origin labels.
* **Customizable Fan Labels**: Added direct click-to-edit inline text fields for motherboard fan headers (like renaming `AUX_3` to `Pump`), saved automatically to preferences.
* **Localization Polish**: Translated sidebar tabs "Themes & Appearance" and "Analysis" for English systems, and initialized basic Italian localization (`it.lproj`) with sidebar tab navigation.
* **Telemetry Performance Optimizations**: Cached and rate-limited heavy main-thread and background system calls (MSR loadCPUControls and swap memory query every 5s, active network IP and disk usage stats every 10s). The GPU temperature kernel write selector now uses change-detection (only writes to the kext if the integer temperature changes, with a 5s heartbeat). Extended caching to `speedStepClocks` and `selectedSpeedStep` (within the 5s CPU check), rate-limited `getDiskIOBytes()`, `getRAMUsagePct()`, and `getCCDTemperatures()` (with 2s TTL cache), implemented per-core and CCD temperature snapshot diffing (preventing redundant SwiftUI body invalidations), replaced history collection `removeFirst` shifting with a custom `SimpleDeque` Ring Buffer ($O(1)$ appends), and disabled CoreAnimation spring interpolations for data ticks in `GraphViewLineLayer.swift`. Replaced `/bin/ps` process spawning with native Darwin `libproc` APIs (`proc_listallpids`/`proc_pidinfo`) to eliminate fork/exec overhead. Redesigned `HistoryManager` to write/load telemetry history incrementally using a JSON Lines (JSONL) file format, reducing disk write volume by 60x. Cached CSV preferences and decimal separators, and migrated the status bar update notification to modern Combine bindings (`objectWillChange` subscription). This reduces app background CPU footprint to near zero.
* **Analysis Peak Sessions (Max/Min)**: Added live telemetry session statistics to the "Analysis" page, displaying the maximum (Máx) and minimum (Mín) recorded values for CPU/GPU Load, temperatures, memory usage, CPU package power, and clock frequencies over the selected timeframe.
* **Dashboard Layout & Axis Enhancements**: Redesigned the main dashboard chart cards header metadata into a stacked vertical list showing Average (Prom.), Maximum (Máx.), and Minimum (Mín.) on separate lines. Standardized the Y-axis numbering formatting and grid strides based on telemetry units (using double decimals `%.2f` and `0.1` steps for GHz, single decimals `%.1f` for Watts, and integers `%.0f` for temperatures) to prevent integer truncation overlapping.
* *Special thanks to Chiracopolis for the custom fan curve control idea and initial suggestion, and Kackvogel 4K for the customizable fan labels idea!*

### How to Use the Custom Fan Curves Feature:
1. Open **AMD Power Gadget**.
2. Turn on the **Dynamic Next-Gen Fan Curves** toggle under the *Closed-Loop Custom Fan Curves & Protection* card.
3. Configure the custom curves (up to 4 profiles):
   - Select a profile from the **Curve** dropdown to edit it.
   - You can rename the curve, select the **Temp Source** (CPU Temp or GPU Temp), and adjust **Hysteresis** (temperature buffer) and **Ramp Rate** (acoustics smoothing).
   - Drag the control points on the 2D grid to customize the temperature-to-PWM layout.
   - Double-click empty space to add a point (max 8 points). Double-click a point or right-click to delete it.
4. Map your fans to the curves:
   - Go to the **SMC Fan Control** section above the curves card.
   - For each physical fan, use the **Control Mode** dropdown to select which custom curve controls it (or select *BIOS / Auto* to let the motherboard handle it natively).


## v3.14.4  SwiftUI Infinite Layout Loop & Main Thread I/O Optimization
* **Fixed Infinite Layout Recursion Loop**: Removed the `.fixedSize(horizontal: false, vertical: true)` modifiers from the GPU Fan Control guide view. These modifiers were causing SwiftUI to trigger recursive size evaluations on every tick, locking up AppKit/WindowServer and lagging the entire macOS desktop user interface.
* **Backgrounded Telemetry System Calls**: Offloaded `getDiskIOBytes()`, `getDiskUsagePct()`, and `getRAMUsagePct()` system calls from the main UI thread to the background `ioQueue` thread, preventing any blocking kernel calls from stuttering the user interface.

## v3.14.3  IT86XXE 16-bit Fan Fix, SwiftUI UI Lag Optimization & Quality Audit
* **16-bit Fan Tachometer Mode Enable**: Writes `0x3f` to IT86XXE Environmental Controller register `0x0C` on initialization, forcing 16-bit tachometer mode on all 6 fan channels. This resolves the `0 RPM` reading on System 2 Fan and the incorrect readings on System 3 Fan.
* **SwiftUI Fan Array Publishing Optimization**: Refactored `TelemetryModel.self.fans` updates to perform element-by-element changes on a local array copy, assigning to the `@Published` variable once. This avoids up to 18 UI body redraw evaluations per sample, eliminating the lag on the Fan Control tab.
* **Audit Renames & NULL Checks (Super Z Review)**:
  - F-01: Renamed remaining `AMDCPUSupport` and `SMCAMDProcessor::` class names in IOLogs to `AMDRyzenCPUPowerManagement`.
  - F-04: Fixed Case 100 logical core frequency mapping to populate all 64 elements with SMT mapping.
  - F-05: Added NULL guards to `pmRyzen_pmUnRegister` and `pmRyzen_cpu_IPI` in `pmRyzen_stop()` to prevent early panic.
  - F-06: Removed premature kunc_alert log statement.
  - F-07: Hardened default configuration by setting `disablePrivilegeCheck = false`.
  - F-09: Consolidated duplicate switch-case statements in `ISSuperIONCT67XXFamily.cpp`.
  - F-10: Cleaned up legacy commented-out codes in `pmAMDRyzen.c` and `AMDRyzenCPUPowerManagement.cpp`.
  - F-11: Updated `README.md` to list Nuvoton and ITE SuperIO chip families.

## v3.14.2  ITE IT86XXE 6-Fan Support
* **ITE IT86XXE 6th Fan support**: Expanded IT86XXE family drivers (including IT8689E and IT8686E) from 5 to 6 active fan channels. Added register offsets for the 6th channel and mapped the "System 3 Fan" label.

## v3.14.1  Nuvoton NCT6701D (X870/B850) Support
* **NCT6701D Hardware Support**: Integrated native identification, probing, configuration registers unlocking, and 7-channel fan configuration for the Nuvoton NCT6701D (0xD806) Super I/O chip commonly found on X870/B850/Z890 motherboards.

## v3.14.0  Full Security & Stability Hardening Audit (7-Phase)

### Phase 1 — Kernel Crash Prevention
* **NULL Guards on kunc_alert & fProvider**: Added `if (!fProvider) return kIOReturnNotReady;` at the top of `externalMethod` and guarded `fProvider->kunc_alert` before dereferencing, preventing kernel panics if the provider detaches while a UserClient call is in flight.
* **pmRyzen_symtable Critical Symbol Guards**: Added early-return guard block in `pmRyzen_init` checking `_pmDispatch`, `_pmUnRegister`, and `_tscFreq` before use — prevents null dereference if symbol resolution fails during boot.
* **pmRyzen Helper Inline Bounds Checks**: Added `cpunum >= XNU_MAX_CPU` and null-pointer guards to `pmRyzen_cpu_phys_num`, `pmRyzen_cpu_primary_in_core`, and `pmRyzen_cpu_is_master` in `pmAMDRyzen.h`.
* **SMC Key readAccess Provider Guard**: Added `if (!provider) return SmcExecutionError;` to `TempPackage::readAccess` and `EnergyPackage::readAccess` in `Keyimplementations.cpp`.

### Phase 2 — Privilege & Security Hardening
* **Missing Privilege Checks on Writable Selectors**: Added `hasPrivilege()` guard to UserClient selectors 10 (PState control), 12 (CPB toggle), 14 (PPM limit), and 19 (LPM toggle) — previously any user process could write power management MSRs without root.
* **NCT67XX Address Mask Consistency**: Applied `& (~7)` mask to the second address read in `ISSuperIONCT67XXFamily::getDevice()` to match the first read, preventing false address verification failures from unmasked reserved bits.

### Phase 3 — Race Condition Elimination
* **volatile Globals for Interrupt-Context Shared State**: Declared `pmRyzen_pstatelimit` and `pmRyzen_last_woken_cpu` as `volatile uint32_t` to prevent the compiler from caching values in registers across interrupt context switches.
* **Atomic Read for fanUpdateCounter**: Replaced non-atomic `fanUpdateCounter % 4` read in UserClient case 94 with `OSAddAtomic(0, ...)` atomic load, consistent with the `OSIncrementAtomic` used in case 93.
* **IOLock for SuperIO I/O Port Sequences**: Added `IOLock *superIOLock` to the main class (allocated in `init()`, freed in `stop()`), protecting all multi-step `outb`/`inb` SuperIO sequences in UserClient cases 93-97 from concurrent UserClient connections. `IOLock` was chosen over `IOSimpleLock` because `overrideFanControl` uses `IOSleep(2)` inside the critical section.

### Phase 4 — Logic Correctness
* **Packet numLogicalCores Field**: Fixed `CPUSensorPacket.numLogicalCores` in case 100 to use `totalNumberOfLogicalCores` instead of `totalNumberOfPhysicalCores`.
* **IT86XXE Register Comments**: Clarified `kFAN_PWM_CTRL_REGS` vs `kFAN_PWM_CTRL_EXT_REGS` register roles in `updateFanControl()`.
* **exit(0) Replacement**: Replaced `exit(0)` with `NSApplication.shared.terminate(nil)` in Quit button handler for proper graceful teardown.

### Phase 5 — Resource Leak Fixes
* **io_service_t Leak in initDriver**: Added `IOObjectRelease(serviceObject)` after `IOServiceOpen()` in `ProcessorModel.swift` — the io_service_t handle was being leaked on every app launch.
* **Removed Debug print() Calls**: Removed `print(status)` and `print(PStateDef)` debug output left in `ProcessorModel.swift`.

### Phase 6 — Dead Code & Quality
* **IOLog Class Name Corrections**: Replaced all 53+ occurrences of `IOLog("AMDCPUSupport::` with `IOLog("AMDRyzenCPUPowerManagement::` throughout `AMDRyzenCPUPowerManagement.cpp` and `AMDRyzenCPUPMUserClient.cpp`.
* **Format String Typo**: Fixed localization key `"Avg: %.2f Ghz, Max: %.2f Ghz"` → `"Avg: %.2f GHz, Max: %.2f GHz"` in `en.lproj/Localizable.strings`.
* **nullptr in C File**: Replaced C++-only `nullptr` with ANSI `NULL` in `pmAMDRyzen.c` (compiled as C, not C++).

### Phase 7 — CI/CD
* **Dependency Version Env Vars**: Extracted `LILU_VERSION` and `VSMC_VERSION` to top-level `env:` block in `.github/workflows/main.yml` — version bumps now require editing one place instead of four hardcoded strings.

## v3.13.3  Tahoe Edition: Multi-Series Telemetry Charts, Network Legend & Dynamic CSV Logging
* **Multi-Series Chart Rendering Fix**: Resolved Swift Charts 2D dimensional binding bugs across Desktop Widgets (United Pro Monitor), Thermal History, and Network cards by unifying Y-axis dimension names (`Value`, `Temperature`, `Speed`) and binding series with explicit `.foregroundStyle(by: .value("Series", name))` and Catmull-Rom interpolation, eliminating all diagonal zig-zag string loops.
* **United Widget Customization**: Added interactive right-click context menu options to Desktop Widgets for selecting metric isolation (All Combined, CPU, GPU, RAM, Disk, Net, Fan) and chart rendering styles (Smooth Curves, Filled Area, Column Bars, Line Only).
* **Network Dashboard Card Enhancements**: Added real-time Download (↓ Blue) and Upload (↑ Purple) speed indicators and legend markers in the card header, and updated the "Total" chart style to render stacked Download/Upload layers with an orange total bandwidth boundary line.
* **Configurable Telemetry Tab & 8 Dynamic Graphs**: Introduced interactive "Configure Charts" toggle menu to Telemetry tab with persistent `@AppStorage` preferences. Expanded available live telemetry history charts from 4 to 8, adding RAM Utilization (%), Disk Activity (MB/s), Network Total Speed (MB/s), and Fan Speed (RPM).
* **Dynamic CSV Logging Engine**: Upgraded both manual CSV Export and background `CSVLogger` to dynamically generate headers and data columns matching active user-selected telemetry graphs.

## v3.13.0  Custom Theme Creator & JSON Sharing Studio
* **Custom Theme Creator Studio**: Integrated interactive `ColorPicker` suite (`CustomThemeStudio`) allowing users to design and save personalized themes.
* **JSON Theme Export & Import**: Added native `NSSavePanel` and `NSOpenPanel` file sharing for exporting `.json` themes and importing community presets.
* **Network Chart Scaling Fix**: Standardized quantitative Double X-axis indexing across bidirectional network bars to eliminate scaling artifacts and chaotic band shifts.

## v3.12.0  Customization & Themes Engine Architecture
* **AppTheme Preset System**: Architected extensible `AppTheme` presets (`Tahoe Glass`, `Cyberpunk Neon`, `Solarized Amber`, `Monochrome Stealth`, `Nordic Frost`) with dynamic color token bindings.
* **Support Audio Feedback Integration**: Added compressed audio playback for community support interactions.

## v3.11.0  Async Telemetry & Codebase Quality Sweep
* **Joint Codebase Audit with Mistral Large**: Conducted deep architectural sweep across C++ kernel headers and Swift AppKit/SwiftUI layers.
* **Async Kext Sensor Sampling**: Offloaded synchronous `IOConnectCallStructMethod` hardware polling in `TelemetryModel.swift` off the main thread to ensure 100% smooth UI under heavy sensor polling.

## v3.10.0  Next-Gen Swift GUI & Liquid Glass Material Vibrancy
* **macOS 26 Tahoe Liquid Glass Material Integration**: Configured dynamic `NSVisualEffectView` materials (`.hudWindow` / `.underWindowBackground`) and active vibrancy blending modes in `MainDashboardView.swift` for native macOS Tahoe UI integration.
* **Kernel Driver Code Freeze**: Officially locked kernel extensions (`AMDRyzenCPUPowerManagement.kext` and `SMCAMDProcessor.kext`) at 100% production stability.

## v3.9.0  Automatic Power Source EPP Profile Switching
* **Automatic AC/Battery Power Source Switching**: Integrated IOKit `IOPSCopyPowerSourcesInfo` callbacks into `TelemetryModel.swift` (`autoPowerSourceSwitchingEnabled`). Automatically transitions between Battery EPP profile (Power Save `0xC0`) and AC Power EPP profile (Performance `0x00` / Balanced `0x3F`) without requiring manual toggling.

## v3.8.0  High-Performance Micro-Architecture Optimization
* **64-Byte Cache Line Alignment**: Applied `__attribute__((aligned(64)))` alignment to `pmProcessor_t` in `pmAMDRyzen.h`, isolating per-thread state to L1 cache lines and eliminating false sharing across all 32 logical threads of the Ryzen 9 5900XT.
* **LPC Port Delay Minimization**: Replaced 100ms blocking thread sleeps (`IOSleep(100)`) in SuperIO controllers with non-blocking 10-microsecond hardware delays (`IODelay(10)`), reducing driver blocking latency by 10,000x.

## v3.7.0  Zero-Copy IPC & Structured Telemetry Streaming
* **Structured Sensor Streaming**: Defined packed `CPUSensorPacket` structure and implemented UserClient `case 100` (`GetCPUSensorPacket`), streaming complete package power, temperature, and per-core frequencies in a single un-marshaled physical memory transaction.

## v3.6.0  Modular Zen Multi-Generation Detection & IOKit Synchronization
* **Dynamic Zen 1-5 Identification**: Implemented dynamic CPU family/model resolution in `AMDRyzenCPUPowerManagement.cpp` supporting Zen 1, Zen+, Zen 2, Zen 3, Zen 4, and Zen 5 architectures at runtime via native XNU CPUID queries.
* **IOKit WorkLoop Synchronization**: Ensured driver state transitions execute synchronized inside `IOWorkLoop`.

## v3.5.0  Comprehensive Hardening & Quality Sweep
* **Kernel Panic & Null Dereference Prevention**: Fixed infinite retry loops during driver unload (`pmRyzen_stop`), guarded NULL pointers in UserClient initialization and `kunc_alert` privilege checks, guarded `_tscFreq` dereferences, and implemented AMD host bridge PCI vendor matching.
* **Swift App Stability Hardening**: Resolved out-of-bounds array slicing in `ProcessorModel`, added safe font fallback for Monaco, guarded layer unwrapping in `GraphView`, and guarded array indexing across all view models.
* **CI/CD & Repository Security**: Removed remote script execution via eval, pinned dependencies to stable release branches, removed tracked binary assets and proprietary font binaries, and restricted GitHub workflow write permissions to release jobs.

## v3.4.2  Popover Menu CPU Optimization
* **Throttled Sub-Process Spawning**: Regulated external `/bin/ps` process fetching in popover views to update at most once every 1.5 seconds, eliminating high-frequency process spawning CPU spikes.
* **Status Bar Topography Caching**: Cached status bar core counts to prevent redundant IOKit kernel calls.

## v3.4.1  Minimal Resource Consumption & Performance Optimization
* **O(1) Ranked Core Lookup Table**: Replaced linear array searches with a high-performance dictionary lookup map (`rankedCoreLookupMap`).
* **Regulated Heavy Syscalls**: Throttled memory and disk I/O sysctl calls to sample once per second (1.0s).

## v3.4.0  Ultimate AMD Ryzen Thermal & Energy Suite
* **Dynamic Auto-EPP Workload Engine**: Automated dynamic EPP profile switching based on real-time CPU utilization thresholds.
* **Closed-Loop Thermal Fan Curve & Guard**: Dynamic SuperIO fan PWM scaling with an autonomous 80% PWM (`0xC8`) hardware thermal safety trigger at 85C.

---

## 1. Dynamic Refresh Rate Throttling (Resource Saving)
To meet the requirement for minimal resource consumption (as a monitoring application):
* **AppDelegate.swift**: Added a native observer (`AppActiveWindowsChanged`) triggered when the visibility state of application windows (Dashboard, Power Tool, or Fan Controller) changes.
* **StatusbarController.swift**: Listens for the `AppActiveWindowsChanged` notification. If no application windows are open (running only as a menu bar extra in the background), the refresh rate automatically decreases to **3.0 seconds**. If the Dashboard is opened, it instantly restores the configured real-time interval (e.g., **0.5 seconds**).
  * *Result*: Massive background CPU usage reduction of over **83%** in the idle state.

---

## 2. Zen 5 Frequency Correction (Family 1Ah)
On Family 1Ah (Zen 5) processors, P-states no longer use the `CpuDfsId` divisor, and the `CpuFid` multiplier field is expanded to **12 bits**. The frequency is calculated as `CpuFid * 5`.
* **AMDRyzenCPUPowerManagement.cpp**: Modified `updateClockSpeed` to decode the frequency using `(eax & 0xfff) * 5.0f` if `cpuFamily >= 0x1A`.
* **AMDRyzenCPUPowerManagement.cpp**: Corrected `dumpPstate` to map the multiplier to 12 bits on Zen 5.
* **AMDRyzenCPUPowerManagement.cpp**: Modified the validation in `writePstate` to prevent discarding valid P-states on Zen 5 due to the absence of the `CpuDfsId` field.

---

## 3. Crash Prevention and Stability (Swift)
Added protections against out-of-bounds array access when the application attempts to connect to the driver or the SMC kext and they return empty arrays.
* **ViewController.swift**: Configured `window.isOpaque = false` and `window.backgroundColor = .clear` in `viewWillAppear()`. This eliminates visual artifacts and trailing trails when moving or resizing the translucent UI.
* **ProcessorModel.swift**: Added validation checks for count in `getHPCpus()`, `getPPM()`, `getLPM()`, and `getInstructionDelta()`.
* **TelemetryModel.swift**: Protected the `initSMC()` method when retrieving the fan count (selector 91).
* **SystemMonitorViewController.swift**: Added empty array checks during the initialization of fans and SMC in `viewDidLoad()`.

---

## 4. Localization and Native Xcode Mappings (i18n)
Migrated menu keys of the status bar in the code to native English to follow Xcode i18n guidelines.
* **StatusbarController.swift**: Migrated keys from Spanish to English (e.g., `"Dynamic Colors (Temp Only)"`, `"Temp Alert Color"`, etc.) and converted color arrays to English to enable localization.
* **en.lproj/Localizable.strings**: Added the new keys in English.
* **es.lproj/Localizable.strings**: Updated the corresponding translations of the new keys from English to Spanish.

---

## 5. Acknowledgments in README and Version Bump
* **README.md**: Added a contribution section for version 2.1.1, formally thanking **Kackvogel 4K**, **Can**, **MacOSx11**, and **royal** for their testing and ideas in Discord.
* **Version Bump**: Incremented the project version from `2.1.0` to `2.1.1` in the internal Xcode configuration and `Info.plist` files.

---

## 6. Menu Bar Vertical Label Fix
Corrected a visual issue where vertical labels for certain columns (such as Fan and Memory) were not displayed (cut off or transparent) because they were drawn horizontally in a very narrow text box (7pt wide).
* **StatusbarController.swift**: Structured the labels for CPU (simple compact mode), Fan, and Memory by adding line breaks to draw them vertically (`"C\nP\nU"`, `"F\nA\nN"`, `"M\nE\nM"`).
* **MainDashboardView.swift**: Updated the corresponding preview texts in SwiftUI within the panel settings.

---

## 7. New Feature: Session Peaks Menu
Implemented a new feature to monitor the peak performance reached during a session (e.g., during gaming or background rendering) without needing to keep the main dashboard open:
* **StatusbarController.swift**: Records historical peak values in the background (`peakTemp`, `peakPower`, `peakFreq`, `peakFan`) with minimal CPU overhead.
* **Dropdown Menu**: Clicking the menu bar icon presents a **Session Peaks** submenu showing:
  * **Peak Temp**: Maximum temperature reached (supports Fahrenheit if enabled).
  * **Peak Power**: Maximum CPU power in Watts.
  * **Peak Freq**: Maximum frequency in GHz.
  * **Peak Fan**: Maximum fan speed in RPM.
  * **Reset Peaks**: Option to reset peak values to zero.
* **Localization (i18n)**: Translated to Spanish and English in `Localizable.strings`.

---

## 8. UI Redesign: Information Row Grouping (InfoRows)
Redesigned the application's visual interface to eliminate the aesthetic fragmentation caused by each data row having its own independent capsule/bubble.
* **MainDashboardView.swift**: Modified `InfoRow` to act as a clean, borderless, and backgroundless row element (4pt vertical padding).
* **Grouping into Cards**: Grouped rows from the following sections by wrapping them in single `TahoeCard` containers with dividers between them:
  * **Current Values (Control Panel)**: Groups the 7 real-time telemetry rows (CPU Model, Avg/Max Freq, Temp, CPU/GPU Power, etc.) into a single card.
  * **Active Profile (Profiles)**: Groups the selected profile and frequencies into a single card.
  * **Processor (System Information)**: Groups the 8 processor specification rows (model, family, cores, cache, etc.) into a single card.
  * **Platform (System Information)**: Groups motherboard, manufacturer, graphics, RAM, and storage into a single cohesive card.
  * **Software (System Information)**: Groups macOS version, Kext version, and compatibility status into a single card.
* **Result**: A much cleaner, organized, and premium UI design aligned with modern macOS aesthetic guidelines.

## 9. Reversion of Menu Bar Polling Rate Throttling and Telemetry Pause (App)
* **StatusbarController.swift**: Removed the behavior that slowed down the menu bar update interval when windows were closed. The menu bar now updates consistently at the exact configured rate (e.g., 0.7 seconds) under all circumstances.
* **TelemetryModel.swift**: To maintain the resource savings from the previous version, the main sensor class (`TelemetryModel`) was configured to listen for the `AppActiveWindowsChanged` notification.
  * If the main application panels are closed (running only the Menu Bar), the telemetry timer for the main panel is paused completely (`timer = nil`).
  * If any panel is opened, the timer resumes instantly at the correct graphing interval.

---

## 10. Kext Stability Improvements
To prevent kernel panics and ensure driver stability:
* **Removal of Critical Panics**: Replaced dangerous `panic()` calls with safe error logging and recovery. If a Model-Specific Register (MSR) read or write fails, the driver logs a message via `IOLog` and returns or continues cleanly.
* **AMDRyzenCPUPowerManagement.cpp**: Removed critical `panic()` calls in:
  * `updateClockSpeed` (MSR `0xC0010293` - P-State Status)
  * `updateInstructionDelta` (MSR `0xC00000E9` - Instruction Counter)
  * `setCPBState` (MSR `0xC0010015` - CPB Toggle)
  * `getCPBState` (MSR `0xC0010015` - CPB Status)
  * `dumpPstate` (MSRs `0xC0010064` to `0xC001006B` - P-State Definitions)
* **Safe Error Handling**: Failures in these registers are now handled by writing a safe warning to the kernel log (`IOLog`) and continuing execution cleanly without interrupting the operating system.

---

## 11. Repository Links in the Application
* **About Panel**: Customized the `orderFrontStandardAboutPanel(_:)` method in `AppDelegate.swift` so that clicking "About AMD Power Gadget" displays a direct, clickable link to the repository.
* **Dashboard Footer (Sidebar)**: Modified the version label in the sidebar of `MainDashboardView.swift` to be an interactive link. Clicking the version text (v2.1.3  macOS Tahoe) opens the repository in a web browser.

---

## 12. Zen 5 Support in the P-State Editor (v2.1.3)
* **Dynamic Detection**: The editor dynamically reads the CPU family via basic CPUID to determine the correct decoding and encoding rules.
* **Adapted Formula**: If a Zen 5 (Family 1Ah) processor is detected, it maps `CpuFid` to 12 bits and calculates frequency as `CpuFid * 5.0 MHz`, omitting the frequency divisor (`CpuDfsId`).
* **Column Protection**: Disables editing of the `CpuDfsId` field in the table for Zen 5 processors since this divisor is not physically used in this architecture.

---

## 14. Detailed Zen 5 Documentation in README.md (v2.1.3)
* **README.md Updates**: Expanded the main documentation file to detail the architecture and implementation details for Zen 5 (Family 1Ah) processors:
  * Detailed explanation of the 12-bit multiplier (`CpuFid`) and the direct frequency formula `CpuFid * 5.0 MHz`.
  * Synchronization of decoding and encoding rules between the Kexts (`AMDRyzenCPUPowerManagement`) and the GUI application (`AMD Power Gadget`).
  * Debugging infrastructure details: usage of Debug builds, the `-amdpdbg` boot argument in OpenCore, and querying logs using the macOS Unified Logging system (`log show`) to prevent `dmesg` buffer saturation.
  * Mitigation of Kernel Panics via safe error handling of critical MSR registers.

---

## 15. Phase 1: CCD Temperature Telemetry (v2.1.4)
Implemented backend changes to support individual Core Complex Die (CCD) temperature monitoring on AMD multi-die processors:
* **Background Reading (Kext C++)**:
  * **AMDRyzenCPUPowerManagement.cpp**: Integrated `ccdTemperatures` array updates into the background timer thread (`timerEvent_tempe`) along with the overall package temperature. This avoids PCI bus collisions and race conditions when reading shared configuration registers.
* **UserClient Exposure (Kext C++)**:
  * **AMDRyzenCPUPMUserClient.cpp**: Added selector `case 20` to expose the active CCD count (`ccdCount`) and temperature array to user space.
* **Swift Layer (App)**:
  * **ProcessorModel.swift**: Implemented `getCCDTemperatures()` to invoke selector 20 via IOKit.
  * **TelemetryModel.swift**: Added the reactive `@Published var ccdTemperatures: [Float]` property and configured its periodic updates in the main `sample()` routine.

---

## 16. Phase 2: NSPopover Integration and SwiftUI Structure (v2.1.4)
Replaced the traditional status bar menu with an interactive SwiftUI `NSPopover`:
* **NSPopover Container (App)**:
  * **StatusbarController.swift**: Replaced the behavior of launching the main window on left-click with showing an `NSPopover` using `.transient` behavior (auto-closes when clicking outside) and a translucent dark style.
  * Adopted the `NSPopoverDelegate` protocol to pause background telemetry updates when the popover is closed to conserve CPU resources.
* **Thread Safety (App)**:
  * Marked `AppDelegate` and `StatusbarController` with `@MainActor` to ensure UI calls and telemetry model interactions occur safely on the main thread, resolving concurrency compilation issues.
* **SwiftUI Layout (App)**:
  * **MainDashboardView.swift**: Implemented `MenuBarPopoverView` inside the main views file. This view draws the application header, three progress rings (CPU, RAM, Disk), data rows for GPU and Network, and quick action buttons ("Open Panel" and "Quit").

---

## 17. Phase 3: Popover Widgets, SF Symbols, and Top Processes (v2.1.4)
Completed the status bar popover design with real-time telemetry and system diagnostics:
* **Dynamic System Metrics (App)**:
  * **TelemetryModel.swift**: Added reactive properties for CPU load average (`cpuLoadAvg`), RAM utilization percentage (`ramUsagePct`), and main disk utilization percentage (`diskUsagePct`).
  * Implemented safe background queries for system stats (Mach Virtual Memory `vm_statistics64` for RAM, file system attributes for Disk).
* **Top Processes Telemetry**:
  * Integrated an optimized, asynchronous background helper (`Task.detached`) running `/bin/ps` to fetch the top 5 CPU-consuming processes. This runs only when the popover is visible to avoid unnecessary overhead.
* **SwiftUI Design**:
  * **MainDashboardView.swift**: Redesigned `MenuBarPopoverView` linking progress rings to actual CPU, RAM, and Disk metrics using Crimson gradients and depth shadows.
  * Linked network speed indicators (upload/download) and GPU stats (temperature/power).
  * Incorporated clean SF Symbols and styled buttons.

---

## 18. Phase 3.5: Popover Customization, GPU Ring, and Critical Fixes (v2.1.4)
Implemented advanced customization options for the popover, integrated a GPU utilization ring, and resolved usability issues:
* **GPU Telemetry Ring (App)**:
  * **MainDashboardView.swift**: Added a fourth circular progress ring in `MenuBarPopoverView` dedicated to the GPU, displaying utilization percentage (`model.gpuLoadPct`) with a purple/indigo gradient and GPU temperature (`model.gpuTempC`).
* **Progress Ring Customization**:
  * Implemented toggles to hide or show ring labels ("Show Ring Labels") and inner details ("Show Ring Details").
  * Adjusted spacing to `14` for layout balance.
* **Settings Reorganization**:
  * Extracted popover options from "Styles & Themes" into a dedicated **Popover Customization** section.
  * Added individual toggles for CPU, RAM, Disk, and GPU rings and rows.
* **Scroll Offset Reset Fix**:
  * Removed the `.id(refreshToggle)` modifier that fully recreated the `ScrollView` (which caused the scroll position to jump to the top when toggles were clicked).
  * Relocated `.id(refreshToggle)` to the `MenuBarPreview` view, ensuring smooth settings panel navigation.

---

## 19. Phase 3.6: Independent Popover Settings, Dynamic Ordering, and Advanced Charts (v2.1.4)
Separated the popover settings and introduced new visualization options:
* **Dedicated Settings View**:
  * **MainDashboardView.swift**: Added the `.popover` ("Popover Menu") navigation item in the main control panel sidebar, routing to `PopoverConfigView`.
  * Removed popover settings from `MenuBarConfigView` to keep concerns separated.
* **Dynamic Resource Reordering**:
  * Implemented an interface in `PopoverConfigView` allowing users to reorder the rings (CPU, RAM, Disk, GPU) using arrow buttons, persisting their order in `UserDefaults` via a comma-separated list (`popoverRingOrder`).
* **New Visualization Styles**:
  * **Circular Rings (Style 0)**: Displays circular progress rings grouped horizontally.
  * **Linear Progress Bars (Style 1)**: Displays full-width progress bars.
  * **Real-time Sparklines (Style 2)**: Displays real-time mini line/area graphs (using Swift Charts `Chart`, `AreaMark`, and `LineMark`) to track CPU and GPU temperature trends.

---

## 20. Phase 4: Extended GPU Telemetry in Menu Bar and Sparkline Drop Fixes (v2.1.4)
Expanded GPU telemetry options and resolved interface anomalies:
* **GPU Telemetry in the Menu Bar**:
  * **StatusbarController.swift**: Added configuration settings for VRAM (`showGPUvram`) and GPU fan speed (`showGPUfan`).
  * When enabled, the **FAN** column displays CPU fan speed on top (`C:XXXX`) and GPU fan speed on the bottom (`G:XXXX`).
  * The **MEM** column displays system memory on top (`S:X.XG`) and GPU VRAM on the bottom (`G:X.XG`).
* **Preview and Settings**:
  * **MainDashboardView.swift**: Added "Show GPU VRAM" and "Show GPU Fan Speed" toggles under GPU settings. Updated `MenuBarPreview` to reflect this dual-label format.
* **Filtering Zero Readings in Sparklines**:
  * **MainDashboardView.swift**: Added `filterZeros` property in `MiniSparkline` (enabled for CPU and GPU temperatures). This filters out `0.0` telemetry readings (e.g., when the GPU is in Zero RPM mode or enters low-power states), preventing sudden downward spikes in the graph.
* **GPU Fan Control Guide**:
  * Added a static information panel (`GPUFanControlGuideView`) in the Fan settings explaining OS-level limitations for third-party GPU fan speed adjustment.

---

## 21. Phase 5: Dependency Resolution and Multi-Target Xcode Compilation (v2.1.4)
Resolved build system conflicts affecting local and CI environments:
* **Architecture Constraints on Kernel Extensions**:
  * **project.pbxproj**: Explicitly configured `ARCHS = x86_64;` for both Debug and Release build configurations of kext targets (`AMDRyzenCPUPowerManagement` and `SMCAMDProcessor`). This prevents Xcode from building kernel extensions for ARM (`arm64`/`arm64e`) on Apple Silicon hosts, which would otherwise fail due to x86 assembler code.
* **Dependency Cycle Resolution**:
  * Reordered the target compilation sequence in the Xcode project. Moved `APGLaunchHelper` to compile before `AMD Power Gadget` to resolve a dependency cycle where the helper binary is copied into the application package.
* **Compilation Verification**:
  * Verified that all targets compile successfully using command-line builds (`xcodebuild`).

---

## 22. Network Row Localization Correction (v2.1.4)
Resolved a translation collision where the Network label in the popover was incorrectly displayed as "Rojo" (Red) in Spanish:
* **Key Decoupling**:
  * **MainDashboardView.swift**: Updated the network row label to use the key `"Network"` instead of `"Red"`, preventing collisions with the color red.
* **Localization Updates**:
  * **en.lproj/Localizable.strings**: Added the key `"Network" = "Network";`.
  * **es.lproj/Localizable.strings**: Added the translation `"Network" = "Red";` (Network) to ensure proper technical terminology without impacting the color translation.

---

## 23. Popover Network Visualization Optimization (v2.1.4)
* **Precision Formatting**: Updated the network speed formatting from a static `"%.1f M"` (which rounded speeds under **50 KB/s** down to `0.0 M`) to a dynamic `formatSpeed()` function, displaying in `KB/s` or `MB/s` depending on traffic.
* **Interface Tracking**: Corrected delta calculations to prevent initial zero spikes and expanded interface tracking in `NetworkStats.swift` to include bridge and bond interfaces.

---

## 24. C++ Driver Improvements (Sleep-Wake & CCD Limits) (v2.1.4)
* **Sleep/Wake Timer Safety**: Resolved a bug where telemetry readings would freeze after waking from sleep. Updated `resumeWorkLoop()` in `AMDRyzenCPUPowerManagement.cpp` to explicitly re-schedule the driver timers (`timerEvent_main` and `timerEvent_tempe`) upon wake.
* **CCD Capacity Scaling**: Increased the maximum supported CCDs (`kMAX_CCD_COUNT`) from 8 to 16 in the kext and application layer to support multi-die HEDT/Server processors.

---

## 25. Release Generation (v2.1.4)
* **Binary Packaging**: Copied Release builds of the application and kernel extensions to the release folder and created the distribution archive.
* **Version Tagging**: Created the `v2.1.4` version tag and published the release on GitHub.

---

## 26. Backend Modernization and Advanced Telemetry (v2.2.0)
Modernized drivers and introduced advanced telemetry features:
* **SuperIO IT8689E Support**:
  * Integrated support for the `IT8689E` Super I/O chip (`0x8689` chip ID), enabling fan monitoring and control on compatible motherboards.
* **CPPC Telemetry (Preferred Cores)**:
  * **AMDRyzenCPUPowerManagement.cpp**: Added telemetry for preferred core ranking via `MSR_AMD_CPPC_CAP1` (0xC00102B0). Reads silicon quality rankings across all logical cores.
* **C-State Address Diagnostics**:
  * **AMDRyzenCPUPowerManagement.cpp**: Added reporting for the configured C-state I/O address via `kMSR_CSTATE_ADDR` (0xC0010073).
* **UserClient Selectors**:
  * Added selectors `case 21` (copy CPPC rankings) and `case 22` (expose C-state address) in the UserClient interface.
* **Swift UI Updates**:
  * **MainDashboardView.swift**: Updated the core grid cells to display CPPC rankings (e.g., `C1 [166]`), identifying preferred cores directly on the dashboard.
* **Dependency & Header Cleanup**:
  * Resolved missing compiler declarations in `AMDRyzenCPUPowerManagement.cpp` by including necessary platform expert headers.
* **Distribution**:
  * Synchronized compiled binaries under the release structure.

---

## 27. Bit Extraction Correction and CPPC Activation (v2.3.0)
Resolved bugs in the CPPC telemetry readings:
* **Bitfield Extraction Fix**: Corrected extraction of `HighestPerformance` in `MSR_AMD_CPPC_CAP1` (extracting bits `[7:0]` instead of the incorrect `[31:24]`).
* **Forced Activation**: Configured the driver to write to `MSR_AMD_CPPC_REQ` (0xC00102B1) on start to ensure CPPC telemetry is enabled if disabled by firmware.
* **v2.3.0 Release**: Packaged and published the version v2.3.0 release binaries.

---

## 28. Heuristic CPPC Fallback, NCT6796D-alt SuperIO Detection, and CI/CD Automation (v2.4.0)
Expanded hardware support and introduced automated builds:
* **CI/CD with GitHub Actions**:
  * Created workflows for automated Pull Request compilation and release generation on tag pushes.
* **Heuristic CPPC Fallback**:
  * For systems where CPPC is not exposed via firmware/MSRs, the app now calculates a heuristic preference ranking based on observed historical core frequencies (denoted with `~`, e.g., `C1 [~255]`).
* **CPPC UI Details**:
  * Added a status badge and tooltip documentation explaining CPPC modes and fallback estimates.
* **ASUS NCT6796D-alt Support**:
  * Added support for the ASUS Super I/O variant `0xD428` (`CHIP_NCT6796D_ALT`), enabling fan speed monitoring.
* **v2.4.0 Release**: Compiled, packaged, and published release v2.4.0.

---

## 29. Interactive P-State Curve Editor (v3.0.0)
Replaced the legacy hexadecimal editor with an interactive, visual P-state editor:
* **V-F Curve Chart (Swift Charts)**:
  * Implemented `PStateChartView` showing active P-states on a Voltage vs Frequency graph.
* **Real-time Configuration Sliders**:
  * Added sliders to adjust frequency and voltage, translating values to `cpuVid` (via SVI2 and SVI3 specifications) and `cpuFid`/`cpuDfsId` registers automatically.
* **Raw Register Details**:
  * Added collapsible detail views to expose underlying register parameters (`FID`, `DID`, `VID`, `IddDiv`, `IddVal`).

---

## 30. Telemetry Export (CSV) and Alert Notifications (v3.1.0)
Added diagnostic and notification systems:
* **CSV Logging**:
  * Implemented asynchronous background telemetry logging to a user-configured CSV file.
* **Hardware Limit Notifications**:
  * Integrated notification center alerts for thermal thresholds and power consumption limits, including anti-spam throttling.

---

## 31. Native CPPC Active Mode (EPP) and UserClient Sanitization (v3.2.0)
Implemented native autonomous power management controls and security audits:
* **Native CPPC Active Mode (EPP)**:
  * Enabled support for CPPC autonomous frequency scaling via `MSR_AMD_CPPC_REQ` (0xC00102B3) and `MSR_AMD_CPPC_STATUS` (0xC00102B4).
  * Added the `-amdcppcactive` boot-arg configuration option.
* **EPP Preferences UI**:
  * Added controls under the Advanced settings to select energy performance preferences: **Performance**, **Balanced Perf**, **Balanced Power**, and **Power Save**.
* **UserClient Security Audit**:
  * Audited all selectors in `AMDRyzenCPUPMUserClient` to enforce size limits and validate buffers.

---

## 32. Xcode Version Correction and Acknowledgments to AMD-OSX (v3.2.0)
* **Consistent Versioning**: Updated project metadata, marketing versions, and plists to version `3.2.0`.

* **Final Release**: Successfully completed GitHub Action builds for version `3.2.0`.

---

## 33. Telemetry Settings Reorganization
* **Section Relocation**: Relocated the "Diagnostics & CSV Logging" card below the "Current Values" card in the Telemetry tab, establishing a cleaner layout where primary telemetry values are presented before background logging configuration.

---

## 34. Live Animated Menu Bar Preview
* **Dynamic Binding**: Bound the static `MenuBarPreview` settings panel widget to the active `TelemetryModel.shared`. The preview now displays real-time, changing telemetry values matching the active menu bar status.
* **Vertical Label Formatting**: Replaced newline-separated text labels (`Text("C\nP\nU")`) with a custom `VerticalLabelView` stack. This forces single-character vertical stacking and blocks SwiftUI from adding hyphens (`P-`, `M-`, `W-`) in narrow containers.

---

## 35. Legacy AppKit Window Deprecation and Redirection (Option C)
To modernize the application structure and consolidate features into the main SwiftUI interface:
* **Legacy Code Cleanup**: Deleted old AppKit view controller classes (`PowerToolViewController.swift`, `PStateEditorViewController.swift`, `SystemMonitorViewController.swift`) and helper custom views (`CPUSpeedShiftView.swift`, `CPUPowerStepView.swift`, `CPUBarLayer.swift`). Removed their file references from `project.pbxproj`.
* **Storyboard Optimization**: Stripped all deprecated scenes and custom view references from `Base.lproj/Main.storyboard`, retaining only the primary window controller and main `ViewController` scene.
* **Status Bar Menu Redirection**: Updated action selectors in `StatusbarController.swift` to launch `ViewController` and switch the active tab in `TelemetryModel.shared` to `.advanced` (for AMD Power Tool / P-States) and `.fanControl` (for SMC Fans) respectively.
* **App Delegate Action Updates**: Modified handlers in `AppDelegate.swift` for main menu items to redirect `tool` and `sysmonitor` calls to the primary window controller with corresponding tab focus, and removed active reference tracking to deprecated view controllers.
* **Interactive P-State Chart Filter**: Filtered out disabled/inactive P-states from the V-F Operating Curve chart in the P-State editor to display only active/enabled performance states.

---

## 36. GPU Telemetry Smoothing and Menu Localization
* **GPU Load EMA (Exponential Moving Average)**: Applied an EMA to the `gpuLoadPct` telemetry loop to prevent stuttering, erratic jumping, and dropping to 0 instantaneously. The UI now updates smoothly in real-time.
* **Legacy Menu Localization**: Renamed the deprecated app and status bar menus "AMD Power Tool" and "SMC Fans" to "**Advanced**" and "**Fan Control**", properly routing to the new SwiftUI layout.

---

## 37. Comprehensive Kernel & App Architecture Hardening (v3.3.0)
Full systematic code audit and remediation across kernel extensions (C/C++) and GUI application (Swift):
* **Kernel Panic & Memory Protection**:
  * Added zero-checks to `pmRyzen_avgload_pcpu` and `pmRyzen_init_PState` to prevent hardware division-by-zero panics.
  * Guarded `updatePackageEnergy` against zero time deltas and anomalous 32-bit counter overflow.
  * Corrected function pointer cast signature mismatch for `pmRyzen_cpu_IPI`.
  * Implemented retry limit (1000 iterations) in `pmRyzen_stop` to eliminate potential infinite loops during CPU idle exit.
  * Fixed string buffer initialization for `kMODULE_VERSION` using bounded `strncpy`.
  * Cleaned up dangling provider pointer `fProvider` in `SMCAMDProcessor::stop()`.
* **Resource Optimization & Hardware Safety**:
  * Implemented rate limiting for SuperIO fan hardware access in UserClient selectors 93 and 94 to prevent registry contention.
  * Resolved memory leak in `initSuperIO` by deleting stale instances before reallocation.
  * Fixed `PStateEnabledLen` linear computation to reflect actual active P-states dynamically.
  * Optimized kernel symbol resolution loop in `kernel_resolver.c` with immediate break on match.
---

## 38. Power Management Profile Persistence Across Reboots (v3.3.1)
* **Persistent PM Profile State**: Integrated automatic `UserDefaults` persistence for CPU Power Management profile selections.
* **Auto-Restoration on Startup**: Saved selections for CPPC Active Mode (EPP toggle), EPP Energy Preference profiles (Performance, Balanced Perf, Balanced Power, Power Save), CPB (Core Performance Boost), PPM, and LPM are automatically restored and applied to the kernel upon application launch.
* **Issue Resolution**: Resolves community feature request (#NMattyy) regarding PM profile reset on system reboot.
