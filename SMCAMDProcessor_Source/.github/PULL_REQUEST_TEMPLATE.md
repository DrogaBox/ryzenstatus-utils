# Pull Request: SMCAMDProcessor & AMD Power Gadget v3.13.3 Release

## Summary of Changes
This PR merges the completed Phase A through Phase E hardening and optimization DAG into `main`.

### Key Highlights
1. **Security & Kernel Panic Fixes**: Privilege checks via `proc_suser`, Mach-O 64-bit magic validation, strict 6-step `stop()` teardown, and bound-checked `initWithTask()` process identity verification.
2. **HEDT Performance & Memory**: `pmProcessor_t` cacheline alignment (removing 8KB padding per core), `XNU_MAX_CPU` perimeter guards, and timer race prevention during power state changes.
3. **App Architecture & UI**: Serial `ioQueue` offloading off `MainActor`, zero-allocation network interface polling, diff-based status bar redraws, and macOS 26 Tahoe SF Symbols 7+ fill glyphs.
